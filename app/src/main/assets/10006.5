Title: Wilson's Theorem
Keywords: number theory, primality test
Subject: 5
Level: 1
FF Description: Here's an interesting characterization of primes:

<P>
Wilson's Theorem.  A number P is prime if and only if
<center>
(P-1)! + 1 is divisible by P.
</center>

<P>
Let's check:
<BR>
(2-1)!+1 = 2, which is divisible by 2.
<BR>
(5-1)!+1 = 25, which is divisible by 5.
<BR>
(9-1)!+1 = 40321, which is not divisible by 9
(cast out nines to see this).

<P> Pretty cool!



Presentation suggestions: 
Behind the fact: However it is not really practical to
use this to test if a number is prime, especially
if P is large:  just try P=101, and you'll
see what I mean!
There are better primality tests available; you can learn
about some of them in a FFact(number theory) class.  See also
FFact(Fermat's+Little+Theorem).
