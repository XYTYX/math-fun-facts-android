Title: All Numbers are Interesting
Keywords: paradox, proof by contradiction
Subject: 8
Level: 2
FF Description: There are clearly many interesting whole numbers.
For instance, 2 is the only even prime number,
3 is the first odd prime, 6 is a perfect number
(the sum of the proper divisors is the number itself), etc.

<P>
But did you know that all whole numbers are interesting?
We shall prove it here.

<P>
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that not all
whole numbers are interesting.
Using the FFact(well-ordering) property of the whole numbers,
among the non-interesting numbers there is a smallest non-interesting number N.
But that would make N interesting, after all,
a contradiction.

<P>
Therefore all numbers are interesting.




Presentation suggestions: 
Behind the fact: This is a rather amusing model of a
proof by FFact(contradiction),
and perhaps shouldn't be taken too seriously!
