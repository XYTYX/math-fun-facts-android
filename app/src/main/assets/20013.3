Title: i to the i is a Real Number
Keywords: i^i, i to the i-th power, i raised to the i, imaginary power
Subject: 3
Level: 2
FF Description: If you are familiar with FFact(complex numbers), the "imaginary" number i has the property that the square of i is -1.  It is a rather curious fact that i raised to the i-th power is actually a real number!
<P>
In fact, its value is approximately 0.20788.











Presentation suggestions: This makes a great exercise after learning the basics about complex numbers.











Behind the fact: From FFact(Euler's+formula), we know that
exp(i*x) = cos(x) + i*sin(x), where "exp(z)" is the exponential function <i>e</i><sup>z</sup>.
Then

<div align=center>
<br>
exp(i*Pi/2) = cos(Pi/2) + i*sin(Pi/2) = i.
</div>
<br>
Raising both sides to i-th power, we see that the right side is the desired quantity i<sup>i</sup>, while the left side becomes exp(i*i*Pi/2), or exp(-Pi/2), which is approximately .20788.
<P>
(Actually, this is one of many possible values for i to the i, because, for instance, exp(5i*Pi/2)=i.  
In FFact(complex analysis), 
one learns that exponentiation with respect to i is a <i>multi-valued</i> function.)
