FF Description: How many ways can you tile a (1 x n) board with
(1 x 1) squares and (1 x 2) dominoes?

<P>
Let's see...
<BR>
A (1 x 1) board can only be tiled 1 way.
<BR>
A (1 x 2) board can be tiled 2 ways: either
two squares or one domino.
<BR>
A (1 x 3) board can be tiled 3 ways: three
squares, or a domino-square, or a square-domino.
<BR>
A (1 x 4) board can be tiled 5 ways...

<P>
Hey, they are all FFact(Fibonacci) numbers!  These are numbers you get
when you start a sequence 0 and 1 and generate the next sequence member by adding the previous two numbers: i.e., 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...





Presentation suggestions: Draw pictures, and have students count the number of
tilings themselves.


Behind the fact: The Fibonacci property can be seen by conditioning
on whether the first tile is a square or domino:  the
number of tilings where the first tile is a square is
the number of ways to tile the remaining (n-1)-length
board, and the
number of tilings where the first tile is a domino is
the number of ways to tile the remaining (n-2)-length
board.  A generalization of this idea can be used to
develop combinatorial interpretations for many
"Gibonacci" identities (recurrences
in which the first terms are not necessarily 1 and 1);
see the Benjamin-Quinn-Su reference for more on this.

<P>
An alternate generalization asks how many ways to tile
an (m x n) board with dominoes; note that the (2 x n) case
is equivalent to tiling a (1 x n) board with FFact(squares) and
dominoes.  See the Graham-Knuth-Patashnik reference.

<P>
Other generalizations can be found
in the Brigham-Caron-Chinn-Grimaldi reference.
If you like this Fun Fact, you'll like all the stuff that is in the Benjamin-Quinn book in the references.
