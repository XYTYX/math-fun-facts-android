FF Description: An <i>irrational</i> number is a number that cannot be
expressed as a fraction.  But are there any FFact(irrational numbers)?
<P>
It was known to the ancient Greeks that there were lengths
that could not be expressed as a fraction.  For instance,
they could show that a right triangle whose side lengths (adjacent
to the right angle) are both 1 has a hypotenuse
whose length is not a fraction.  By the FFact(Pythagorean+theorem) this length is Sqrt[2]
(the square root of 2).  We shall show Sqrt[2] is irrational.

<P>
Suppose, to the contrary, that Sqrt[2] were rational.
Then Sqrt[2]=m/n for some integers m, n in <i>lowest terms</i>, i.e., m and n have no common factors.
Then 2=m<sup>2</sup>/n<sup>2</sup>, which implies that m<sup>2</sup>=2n<sup>2</sup>.
Hence m<sup>2</sup> is even, which implies that m is even.
Then m=2k for some integer k.

<P>
So 2=(2k)<sup>2</sup>/n<sup>2</sup>, but then 2n<sup>2</sup> = 4k<sup>2</sup>, or
n<sup>2</sup> = 2k<sup>2</sup>.  So n<sup>2</sup> is even.
But this means that n must be even, because the square
of an odd number cannot be even.

<P>We have just showed that both m and n are even,
which contradicts the fact that m, n are in lowest terms.
Thus our original assumption (that Sqrt[2] is rational)
is false, so the Sqrt[2] must be irrational.




Presentation suggestions: This is a classic FFact(proof by contradiction).

Behind the fact: You may wish to try to prove that Sqrt[3] is irrational
using a similar technique.
It is also instructive to see why this proof fails for
Sqrt[4] (which is clearly rational).
The above proof fails for Sqrt[2] because at the point
in the proof where we deduce that m<sup>2</sup>
is divisible by 4, we cannot conclude that
m is divisible by 4.
