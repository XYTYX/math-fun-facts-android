Title: Complex Roots Made Visible
Keywords: imaginary, complex numbers, finding complex roots
Subject: 1

FF Description: Everyone learns that the FFact(roots of a polynomial) have a
graphical interpretation: they're the places where the
function crosses the x-axis.  But what happens when the
equation has only imaginary roots?  Do those have a
graphical interpretation as well?

<P> Here's an interpretation that works for quadratics.

Take a quadratic, such as 2x<sup>2</sup> - 8x + 10, and
graph it.  In the FFig(1), it is shown in
red.  Because it lies entirely
above the x-axis, we know it has no real roots.

<P> Now, reflect the graph of this FFact(quadratic)
through its bottom-most point,
and find the x-intercepts of this new graph,
shown in green.  Finally, treat these intercepts as if
they were on opposite sides of a perfect circle, and
rotate them both exactly 90 degrees.  These new points
are shown in blue.

<P>
If interpreted as points in the FFact(complex plane),
the blue points are exactly the roots of the original
equation!  (In our example, they are 2+i and 2-i.)




Presentation suggestions: Use different colors of chalk to represent various parts
of the diagram.









Behind the fact: You can prove it by expanding the generic equations:
<BR>
(x-a)<sup>2</sup> + b and -(x-a)<sup>2</sup> + b
<BR>
and then comparing their roots
(using the quadratic equation).
