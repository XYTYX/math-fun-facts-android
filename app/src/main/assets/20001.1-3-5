Title: Quick Square Roots
Keywords: Newton's method, dynamical systems
Subject: 1, 3, 5
Level: 2
FF Description: <P>
Here's a very quick way to generate the square root of N.
Let A<sub>0</sub>=N. Then generate a FFact(sequence) of numbers
A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, etc.
(on your calculator, for instance) by using the formula:
<CENTER>
<BR>
A<sub>k+1</sub> = 1/2 ( A<sub>k</sub> + (N/A<sub>k</sub>) ).
</CENTER>
<BR>
This will give a sequence that converges very quickly to
the square root of N. In fact, it converges so quickly,
that it generally doubles the number of correct digits
after each step!

<P> This formula arises as a result of using FFact(Newton's method).
Can you figure out how?


Presentation suggestions: Draw a picture, if it is helpful, of how Newton's method works.
Challenge them to explore what happens if you start off
with different values of A<sub>0</sub>.


Behind the fact: Repeatedly applying a function over and over is called
<I>iteration</I>.  Iterated functions
are studied in <I>FFact(dynamical systems)</I>.
Newton's method is one example of how iteration can be
very useful.
