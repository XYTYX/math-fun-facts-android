Title: Mug Trick
Keywords: fundamental group, topology
Subject: 1, 2, 7
Level: 2
FF Description: Take a mug that has a handle, and fill it with coffee.
Hold the mug in your hand.  Now, without letting go of
the mug (or changing the position of your mug relative
to your hand), and without spilling the coffee, see if you
can rotate the mug TWO FULL TURNS and return your
hand, arm, and cup to their original positions.

<P>
If you can do that, can do it the same
trick with only ONE full turn?  (No!)

<!-- needs picture

Take off your belt and let it hang vertically from one hand.
Give the bottom of the belt TWO full twists.
Now without twisting your hands or letting go of the belt
(though you may certainly "rigidly" move your hands),
deform the belt so that it no longer has any twists in it.

Now give the belt only one full twist.
Can you do the same trick?
(No!)

Presentation suggestions: Do it!  Just don't fill the mug with <i>hot</i> coffee!
You may wish to point the handle north at the beginning
of the trick, so that students can track how many times
the mug turns.  Now gradually rotate the cup towards
your chest, then under your elbow... this will bring
the cup through one rotation, but your arm will be twisted.
Keeping the cup upright and rotating in the same direction
will now force you to rotate the cup over your head.  Then
bring the cup down and you will have given it two full
turns and brought your arm back to its starting position.
<P> Students will enjoy knowing that this trick is
evidence of some deep mathematics, even if they don't
understand it, so be sure to tell them about the math.
Also, even if students only pick up the "buzzwords"
(like "fundamental group"), it is still useful, because
it all helps to popularize mathematics.
(How many of us know what "string theory" really is?
But hasn't that given physics a lot of glamor?)




Behind the fact: See the Fun Fact on the FFact(Fundamental+Group).
Continuously rotating a
mug is equivalent to following a path in "SO(3)",
the space of rotations in 3-space,
and if you start and end the mug in the same
orientation, you have traced a "loop" in SO(3).
<P>
The reason this trick works for 2 twists but not 1 twist
is because the fundamental group of SO(3) is "Z/2",
the cyclic group of order 2.  In layman's terms,
this means that of all the ways you can twist a mug
and return it to its original position, in only half
of them will you be able to return your whole
arm to its original position, and these are precisely
the ones in which the mug rotates an even number of times.

<P>
You can learn more about the fundamental group in a FFact(topology) course.

<!--
All loops in SO(3)
fall into one of two categories,
those for which the trick works or does not work.
Every point along the center of your belt
represents an orthonormal frame in 3-space,
and moving along the belt describes a path (in fact,
a loop, since the last frame is identical to the first one)
in the space of orthonormal frames in 3-space, which is the same as
the space of rigid motions of 3-space that fix the origin.
Though one twist gives a path that cannot be deformed
back to the constant path
(i.e. one in which all the frames are the same),
going around that path TWICE is deformable to the
constant path.
