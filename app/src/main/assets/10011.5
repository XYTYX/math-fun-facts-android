Title: tamreF's Last Theorem
Keywords: Fermat's last theorem
Subject: 5

FF Description: Here's an amusing theorem that is very easy to prove,
which we'll call <i>tamreF's Last Theorem</i>.
In fact it is tamreF's only known theorem.  It says:

<P>
<i>The following equation
<BR>
<CENTER>
N<sup>x</sup> + N<sup>y</sup> = N<sup>z</sup>
<BR>
</CENTER>
has no solutions in positive integers for N
greater than 2.
</i>

<P>
This theorem has not been unsolved for centuries;
in fact, it was solved as soon as it was posed.  It is
much easier to prove than its counterpart:
FFact(Fermat's+Last+Theorem).






Presentation suggestions: 
Behind the fact: The proof is ridiculously easy;
consider the equation in base N.
Perfect powers of N consist of a 1 followed by
many zeroes.  Adding two such numbers cannot be
a number of that form unless N=2 and the 1's are in
the same position.
