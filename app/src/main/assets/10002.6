Title: Drunken Walker and Fly
Keywords: probability
Subject: 6
Level: 1
FF Description: Imagine a drunken
person wandering on the number line who starts at 0, and
then moves left or right (+/-1) with probability 1/2.  What is the
probability that the walker will eventually return to her
starting point
Answer: probability 1.
<P>
What about a FFact(random walk) in the plane, moving on the integer
lattice points, with probability 1/4 in each of the coordinate
directions?  What's the chance of return to the starting
point?
Answer: also probability 1.
<P>
OK, now what about a drunken fly, with 6 directions to
move, probability 1/6?  Surprisingly, it is probable that
the fly will never return to its start.  In fact it only
has probability around 1/3 of ever returning.



Presentation suggestions: Try to give a little insight by illustrating a random walk
on the line for several steps.


Behind the fact: A probabilist would say that simple random walks on the line and
plane are <I>recurrent</I>, meaning that 
with FFact(probability) one
the walker would return to his starting point, and that
simple random walks in dimensions 3 and higher are
<I>transient</I>, meaning there is a positive probability
that he will never return!  This is because there is so
much "space" in dimensions 3 and higher.
