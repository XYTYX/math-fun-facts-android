Title: One Equals Zero!
Keywords: algebra false proof, paradox
Subject: 1, 8

FF Description: The following is a "proof" that one equals zero.

<P>
Consider two non-zero numbers x and y such that
<CENTER>
x = y.
<BR>
Then x<sup>2</sup> = xy.
<BR>
Subtract the same thing from both sides:
<BR>
x<sup>2</sup> - y<sup>2</sup> = xy - y<sup>2</sup>.
<BR>
Dividing by (x-y), obtain
<BR>
x + y = y.
<BR>
Since x = y, we see that
<BR>
2 y = y.
<BR>
Thus 2 = 1, since we started with y nonzero.
<BR>
Subtracting 1 from both sides,
<BR>
1 = 0.
</CENTER>

<P>
What's wrong with this "proof"?



Presentation suggestions: This Fun Fact is a reminder for students to always
check when they are dividing by unknown variables
for cases where the denominator might be zero.



Behind the fact: The problem with this "proof"
is that if x=y, then x-y=0.  Notice that halfway
through our "proof" we divided by (x-y).

<P>
For a more subtle "proof" of this kind,
see FFact(One+Equals+Zero:+Integral+Form).
