Title: Pass the Beer
Keywords: random walk
Subject: 6
Level: 2
FF Description: Suppose you and a bunch of friends are sitting around a
table.  There are N of you.  You have a jug of beer in
front of you, which no one has yet tasted.

<P>
So you take a swig of it, and then pass it
to your left or right with probability 1/2.
Now suppose your neighbor does the same---she takes a swig
of it and passes it to her left or right with probablity
1/2.  Each player continues in this fashion.

<P>
Because the beer is moving back and forth FFact(randomly) around
the table, it may be a while before some people get
to taste the beer for the first time.

<P>
Which person around the table is <i>most likely</i> to be
the <i>last</I> one to try the beer?  Is it a person
near you or far from you?  (Assume that the jug is
bottomless, and never runs out.)

<P>
The surprising answer is that ALL participants (except
the first) are EQUALLY LIKELY (probability 1/(N-1))
to be last!




Presentation suggestions: Poll the class before you tell them
the answer.  Draw a diagram on the board, mark the starting
person,
and then point to various other persons on the diagram and
ask "How many think it is this person?  Or this one?"

<P>You'll find that most people think the answer is the
person farthest away from the starting person.


Behind the fact: Try calculating the FFact(probability) for some specific cases:
n=3 is trivial (1/2 each of the other 2 players). The case n=4 is a
little more challenging.  The general case can be proved
by considering any fixed player and
conditioning on the time when the beer first reaches one
of his neighbors.
