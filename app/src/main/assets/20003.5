Title: Prime Number Theorem
Keywords: number theory, distribution of primes, how many primes, calculus
Subject: 5
Level: 2
FF Description: Fix some number N.  What fraction of the integers
less than or equal to N are prime?

<P>
Thinking about it, we know that primes occur less and less
often as N grows.  Can we quantify this somehow?

<P>
Let Pi(N) denote the number of primes less than or equal
to N that are prime.  Then we expect that the
fraction Pi(N)/N must change (decrease?)
with N.  In fact there is an amazing theorem called the
Prime Number Theorem which says that
<CENTER>
<BR>
Pi(N)/N is asymptotic to 1/ln(N)
</CENTER>
<BR>
which means that the ratio of those two quantities
approaches 1 as N goes to infinity!  Thus Pi(N) is
closely approximated by N/ln(N).  In fact, a better
estimate for Pi(N) is that it is very closely
approximated by this FFact(integral):
<CENTER>
<BR>
INTEGRAL<sub>2 to x</sub> dt/ln(t) .
</CENTER>




Presentation suggestions: Write out a table of Pi(N) for the first few values of N
(or flash a transparency)
just to give students a concrete feel for this function
before telling them the answer.



Behind the fact: The proof of the Prime Number Theorem requires some hard
asymptotic analysis.  Several people have proved
various versions of the Prime Number Theorem; among them
Chebyshev, Hadamard, de la Vallee Poussin, Atle, Selberg,
although the theorem was suspected by Gauss (1791).
