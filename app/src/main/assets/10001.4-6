Title: Matching Problem
Keywords: probability, combinatorics
Subject: 4, 6
Level: 1
FF Description: Suppose I return N homeworks randomly to my N students.
What is the chance that no student gets back her
own homework?  In a class of 30?  Would it be more or
less if I had more students?

<P>
Surprising answer:  the chance that no one gets back
her own homework is approximately (1/<i>e</i>), which is
approximately 36.8 percent of the time!

<P>
And the answer is about the same, no matter how many
students you have!  (It gets closer and closer to 1/<i>e</i>
the larger N gets, and is already a very good
approximation for 5 students.)

<P>Gee, where did the number <i>e</i> come from?


Presentation suggestions: Poll the class about the probabilities
before you tell them the answer, just to
see how good their intuition is.


Behind the fact: This interesting fact is usually proved in classes in
discrete mathematics or FFact(probability), 
using something called the inclusion-exclusion principle.  The answer
turns out to be the partial sum of an FFact(infinite series)
for 1/<i>e</i>.
