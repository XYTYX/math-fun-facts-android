Title: Large Counterexample
Keywords: number theory
Subject: 5

FF Description: A positive integer is said to be of <i>even type</i>
if its factorization into FFact(primes)
has an even number of primes.  
Otherwise it is said to be of <i>odd type</i>.
Examples: 4=2*2 is even type, 18=2*3*3 is odd type.
(We say 1 has 0 primes and is therefore of even type.)

<P>
Let E(n)= the number of positive integers <= of even type.
<BR>
Let O(n)= the number of positive integers <= n of odd type.
<BR>
What can be said about the relative size of E(n) and O(n)?
Are there more of one than the other?

<P>
Perhaps O(n) >= E(n) for all n>=2?  After all, products of
primes come "before" products of two primes...

<P>This statement is known as <i>Polya's conjecture</i>,
and dates back from 1919.  After it was checked for all
n <= a million, many people believed it had to be true.
But a belief is not a proof... and in fact the conjecture
is false!

<P>In 1962, Lehman found a counterexample:
at n=906180359, it is the case that O(n)=E(n)-1.


Presentation suggestions: Students may be able to come up with a FFact(conjecture)
if you start with some examples.  You may wish to make
the conjecture more plausible with some other "heuristic"
arguments.


Behind the fact: This example drives home the point that "obvious"
facts, checked for many cases, to not constitute
a proof for all integers!
