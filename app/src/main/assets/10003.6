Title: Buffon Needle Problem
Keywords: pi formula, probability
Subject: 6
Level: 1
FF Description: A plane is ruled with parallel lines 1 cm apart.  A needle
of length 1 cm is dropped randomly on the plane.
What is the probability that the needle will be lying
across one of the lines?

<P>
Answer: 2/Pi.

This gives an interesting way to calculate Pi!
If you throw down a large number of needles, the fraction
of needles which lie across a line will get closer to 2/Pi
the more needles that you throw.  So, you can just throw
down needles and count them to get an estimate for Pi!

Presentation suggestions: Draw a picture and a few "random" needles.
As a challenge, ask students to prove this formula using FFact(calculus), 
and assuming that needle centers and needle
angles are uniformly distributed.






Behind the fact: This method of calculating Pi is very slow.  There are
faster formulas, see FFact(pi+formula).  However, the idea
of using a probabilistic means to get answers like this
is very powerful, and is the basis of something called the
Monte Carlo method in FFact(probability) theory.
