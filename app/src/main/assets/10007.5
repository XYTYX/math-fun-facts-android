Title: Fermat's Little Theorem
Keywords: number theory, primality test
Subject: 5
Level: 1
FF Description: Fermat's little theorem gives a condition that a prime
must satisfy:

<P>
Theorem.  If P is a prime, then for any integer A,
<center>
( A<sup>P</sup> - A ) must be divisible by P.
</center>

<P>
Let's check:
<BR>
2<sup>9</sup> - 2 = 510, is not divisible by 9, so it
cannot be prime.
<BR>
3<sup>5</sup> - 3 = 240, is divisible by 5, because 5 is
prime.



Presentation suggestions: This may be a good time to explain the difference
between a necessary and sufficient condition.



Behind the fact: This theorem can be used as a way to test if a number is
<i>not</i> prime,
although it cannot tell you if a number is prime.

<P>
Fermat's theorem is a special case of a result known as Euler's theorem:
that for any positive integer N, and any integer A relatively prime to N:
<center>
( A<sup>phi(N)</sup> - A ) must be divisible by N,
</center>
<br>
where phi(N) is <i>Euler's totient function</i> that returns the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that are relatively prime to N.  So when N is prime, phi(N)=N.

<p>
Fermat's "little" theorem should not be confused with FFact(Fermat's+Last+Theorem).
