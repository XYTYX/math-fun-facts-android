Title: Area of a Hyperbolic Wedge
Keywords: analytic geometry
Subject: 2
Level: 1
FF Description: The unit circle can be parametrized by (cos w, sin w).
Given a point on it, the region cut out by
this circle, the x-axis, and
the ray from the origin to this point
has area w/2.

As you may know,
the hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine functions
are similar to the usual cosine and sine; they obey
similar properties.  Here's a cool fact that is
parallel to the one above.

<P>
The parametrization (cosh w, sinh w) parametrizes a
hyperbola.  Given a point on it,
the region cut out by this hyperbola, the x-axis, and
the ray to from the origin to this point
also has area w/2!

Behind the fact: The above fact can be verified by
integration in FFact(polar coordinates).
