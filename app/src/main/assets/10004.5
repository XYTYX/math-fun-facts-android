Title: Pi Approximations

FF Description: Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to
its diameter.  It is known to be FFact(irrational) and its
decimal expansion therefore does not terminate or repeat.
The first 40 places are:

<P>
3.14159 26535 89793 23846 26433 83279 50288 41971...

<P> Thus, it is sometimes helpful to have good
fractional approximations to Pi.
Most people know and use 22/7, since 7*Pi
is pretty close to 22.  But 22/7 is only good
to 2 places.  A fraction with a larger denominator
offers a better chance of getting a more refined estimate.
There is also 333/106, which is good to 5 places.

<P> But an outstanding approximation to Pi is the following:
<CENTER>
355/113
</CENTER>
This fraction is good to 6 places!  In fact, there is
no "better approximation" among all fractions (P/Q) with
denominators less than 30,000.  [By "better approximation"
we mean in the sense of how close Q*Pi is to P.]



Presentation suggestions: Have people verify that 355/113 is a good rational
approximation.  You can also point out that 355/113 is
very easy to remember, since it consists of the digits
113355 in some order!



Behind the fact: The theory of <i>continued fractions</i> allows one to
find good rational FFact(approximations) of any irrational number.
This is covered in an introductory course on FFact(number theory)!
