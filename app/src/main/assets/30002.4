Title: Dinner Party Problem
Keywords: graph theory, Ramsey theory
Subject: 4
Level: 3
FF Description: How many people must you have at dinner to ensure that
there are a subset of 3 people who all either
mutual acquaintances, or mutual strangers?

<P>
We can model this using <i>FFact(graph theory)</i>;
for background see the Fun Fact FFact(Six+Degrees+of+Separation).
Let people be vertices, and draw a red edge between two
people if they know each other, and a blue edge if they
do not.  So every pair of people are connected by either
a red or blue edge.

<P>
The question then becomes, what is the least number of
vertices for which every complete red-blue graph
on those vertices has
either a red or blue triangle?

<P>
Answer: 6 people!  First we show that 6 people are enough:
take any vertex, Fred.  Fred has 5 edges emanating from
him; at least 3 are the same color.
Suppose without loss of generality it is red.  If any of
those 3 people that Fred knows know each other, then
we have a red triangle!  If none of
those 3 know each other, we have a blue triangle!

<P>
Now, using red-blue graphs, can you draw a red-blue
complete graph on 5 vertices with no blue nor red triangle?
(This shows that 5 people are not enough.)
See the Figure for a solution (it appears after several
seconds).




Presentation suggestions: Bring colored chalk into the class;
draw pictures as you are giving the proof.
It doesn't matter if students don't follow the
exact argument in class--- they will probably go home
and want to think about it anyways--- but they will
draw the pictures you draw and it will help them
construct the argument later.




Behind the fact: Generalizations of this problem, involving the
least number of people you have to invite to ensure
subgraphs of other types, fall under the category of
something called FFact(Ramsey Theory).
