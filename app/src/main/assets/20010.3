Title: Ellipsoidal Paths
Keywords: algebraic geometry
Subject: 3
Level: 2
FF Description: Given an FFact(ellipse), and a smaller ellipse strictly
inside it, start at a point on the outer ellipse,
and in a counterclockwise fashion (say),
follow a line tangent to the inner ellipse
until you hit the outer ellipse again.  Repeat.
FFig(1) shows an example.

<P>
Now it is quite possible that this path will never
hit the same points on the outer ellipse twice.  But
if it does "close up" in a certain number of steps,
then something amazing is true:
<i>all</i> such paths, starting at <i>any point</i>
on the outer ellipse, close up in the same number of
steps!

<P>
This fact is known as <i>Poncelet's Theorem</i>.


Presentation suggestions: Intuition may be gained by presenting special cases,
such as where the ellipses are concentric circles.


Behind the fact: This process that produces this path may be thought of as a
<i>dynamical system</i> on the outer ellipse,
and is related to the study of <i>circle maps</i>
and <i>rotation numbers</i> in FFact(dynamical systems).
You can learn more about Poncelet's theorem in
any classical text on algebraic geometry.
