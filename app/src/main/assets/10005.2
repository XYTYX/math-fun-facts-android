Title: Morley's Theorem
Keywords: 
Subject: 2
Level: 1
FF Description: Take any triangle.  Mark the 3 points which are the
intersections of adjacent angle trisectors.  No matter
what triangle you start with, these 3 points will form
an equilateral triangle!


Presentation suggestions: Draw a picture and invite students to draw their own
triangle on a sheet of paper and follow along.


Behind the fact: This is yet another surprising fact from 
FFact(geometry).  Can
you think of a proof?
