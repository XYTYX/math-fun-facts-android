Title: Face Derivatives and Computer Vision
Keywords: calculus, linear algebra
Subject: 3
Level: 2
FF Description: One challenge in robotics is the problem of
<i>computer vision</i>: how do you program a computer
to interpret and "understand" the data it receives from
some visual sensor?  For example, one aspect of this
problem is object <i>recognition</i>, and another is
object <i>tracking</i>.

<P>
While recognition is a very hard problem
(that won't concern us here), if you know what an
object looks like, it can be tracked using some
interesting mathematical ideas.

<P>
Suppose you are trying to track the face in Figure 1
as it moves in a sequence of frames.
The visual data in each frame is
an array of numbers (pixel intensities).  Naively,
you might track the face by searching each frame for
an pattern of numbers similar to the one in FFig(1).
But this can be very computationally intensive.

<P>
Here is a better method used by computer scientists.
The key idea is <i>linearization</i>---
while an object's motion may not be linear,
for small time steps it is approximately FFact(linear).
So we would expect that the frames alter
in approximately linear ways.

<P>And they do!
In the first row of FFig(2), we see a face moving
left in a sequence of frames (look at them right-to-left).
We can approximate the motion by looking at the frame in
the first row labeled "+1 pix" and "subtracting"
the original frame.  This difference is shown in FFig(3).
(If you like, you can think of it as a "derivative"
representing the face's motion!)
If we assume that the face's true motion is just the motion in FFig(3)
repeated over and over, we get the approximation in
the second row of FFig(2)!  As you can see,
it remains a pretty good
FFact(approximation) for small numbers of steps.  So we can
"track" the face using this idea, as described below.







Presentation suggestions: 
Behind the fact: In practice,
the array of pixel intensities is encoded as a
(very long) vector of numbers.  The space of all possible
pictures forms a vector space, and the vector associated
with FFig(2) forms a vector V.  Tracking an object then
correponds to
finding the component of a given vector (picture)
in the direction of V, and the multiple of V tells us
the amount of the translation!
Other motions can also be treated in this way,
such as shifts up/down, rotation, scalings, etc.
These correspond to vector components in other directions.
(Thanks to Zach Dodds for providing the pictures,
and Ran Libeskind-Hadas for providing his face!)

<p>
You can study linearity and vector spaces in a FFact(linear algebra) course.
