Title: Sum of Cubes
Keywords: proofs without words, number theory
Subject: 2, 5
Level: 1
FF Description: The sum of cubes is just the square of the triangular numbers!
<CENTER>
<B>1</B><sup>3</sup> + <B>2</B><sup>3</sup>
+ ... + <B>n</B><sup>3</sup> =
(<B>1</B> + <B>2</B> + ... + <B>n</B>)<sup>2</sup>.

And there is a nice proof by picture, too.  Can you figure out how this
diagram illustrates the identity?

Presentation suggestions: Draw this picture and see if your students can figure out why the diagram is
a "FFact(proof without words)"!


Behind the fact: The diagram illustrates the identity for <b>n</b>=3.
Note that the square has
(1+2+3)<sup>2</sup> letters in it.
But now I also claim that there is 1<sup>3</sup> red letter,
2<sup>3</sup> green letters,
and 3<sup>3</sup> blue letters.

<P>
This can be seen by arranging the letters in "layers" of a cube!
The  red cube has one layer (A).
The green cube has two layers (A and B) with 4 letters in each.
The blue cube has three layers (A, B, and C) with 9 letters in each.

<P>
This construction easily generalizes for arbitrary <b>n</b>.
You can follow this with the Fun Fact
FFact(Sum+of+Cubes+and+Beyond).
