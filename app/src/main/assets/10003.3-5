Title: Wallis' Formula
Keywords: pi formula
Subject: 3, 5
Level: 1
FF Description: Here's a fun FFact(formula for Pi) involving an infinite product,
known as Wallis' Formula:
<center>
<br>
<table align=center>
<tr>
<td>
(Pi/2) =
</td>
<td>(2*2)<hr noshade>(1*3)</td>
<td>(4*4)<hr noshade>(3*5)</td>
<td>(6*6)<hr noshade>(5*7)</td>
<td> ... </td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br>
It is somewhat surprising that when you pull out
every other pair of terms, you get a completely different
kind of number!
<center>
<br>
<table align=center>
<tr>
<td>
Sqrt[2] =
</td>
<td>(2*2)<hr noshade>(1*3)</td>
<td>(6*6)<hr noshade>(5*7)</td>
<td>(10*10)<hr noshade>(9*11)</td>
<td> ... </td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br>











Presentation suggestions: You can also start with the infinite product, and ask
if student can guess what it converges to, before you
tell them the answer.






Behind the fact: There is an infinite product formula for the sine function
which yields Wallis' formula as a consequence.
Infinite products are defined as the FFact(limit) of the
partial products, which are finite.  This is similar
to the way we define FFact(infinite sums)!

<i>An anonymous contributor points out:</i>
The history behind this formula is particularly
fascinating. Wallis derived it by doing some fancy and
unjustified interpolating.
Newton was fascinated by this and used the same
technique to derive the (generalized) binomial formula,
a result that he regarded as one of his major achievements.
