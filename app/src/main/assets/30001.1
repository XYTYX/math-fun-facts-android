Title: Really Complex Matrices
Keywords: complex numbers, linear algebra
Subject: 1
Level: 3
FF Description: If you know how to multiply 2x2 matrices, and know about
FFact(complex numbers), then you'll enjoy this connection.  Any
complex number (a+bi) can be represented by a real 2x2
matrix in the following way!

Let the 2x2 matrix
<center>
<BR>
<font face="courier">
[  a b ]
<BR>
[ -b a ]
</font>
</center>
<BR>
correspond to (a+bi).  Addition of complex numbers then
corresponds to addition of the corresponding 2x2 matrices.
So does multiplication!  Observe if you take this product:
<center>
<BR>
<font face="courier">
[  a b ] [  c d ]
<BR>
[ -b a ] [ -d c ]
</font>
</center>
<BR>
you get
<center>
<BR>
<font face="courier">
 [  (ac-bd) (ad+bc) ]
<BR>
[ -(ad+bc) (ac-bd) ]
</font>
</center>
<BR>
which is precisely what you would get if you multiplied
(a+bi) and (c+di) and then converted to a 2x2 matrix!






Presentation suggestions: Let students do the multiplication, or maybe have done
it already for homework before you present this fun fact.
As a follow up Fun Fact, note that taking determinants of these matrices
produce
FFact(Products+of+Sums+of+Two+Squares).











Behind the fact: The reason this works is because complex multiplication
can be viewed as a linear transformation on the 2-dimensional
plane.  In FFact(linear algebra), you learn that every linear transformation
can be represented as matrix multiplication by a suitable matrix.
