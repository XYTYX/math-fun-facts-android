Title: Gamma Function
Keywords: calculus, continuous factorial
Subject: 3
Level: 2
FF Description: The Gamma function is an amazing integral:
<BR>
<CENTER>
Gamma(x) = INTEGRAL<sub>t=0 to infinity</sub>
t<sup>x-1</sup> <i>e</i><sup>-t</sup> dt .
</CENTER>

<P>
Using integration by parts, you can show that this
function satisfies the property
<BR>
<CENTER>
Gamma(x) = (x-1) Gamma(x-1).
</CENTER>
<BR>
Using Gamma(1)=1, you can calculate Gamma(2), Gamma(3),...
<BR>
Does this remind you of anything?

<P>
Surprise: the Gamma function satisfies
Gamma(n) = Factorial(n-1).
<BR>
(I would have used the notation "!" but you might
think I was just excited!)
<P>
So you can think of the Gamma function as being a
continuous form of the FFact(factorial) function.  It satisfies
lots of cool properties; here is just one:
<BR>
<CENTER>
Gamma(1/2) = Sqrt[Pi].
</CENTER>





Presentation suggestions: FFact(Calculus) students might be challenged to
compute Gamma(2), Gamma(3), etc. and discover the
connection with the factorial function.
You may wish to assign the integration by parts as
a homework exercise prior to presenting this Fun Fact.





Behind the fact: The Gamma function is an important function in analysis,
FFact(complex analysis), 
FFact(combinatorics), 
and FFact(probability).
