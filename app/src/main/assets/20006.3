Title: Koch Snowflake
Keywords: real analysis
Subject: 3
Level: 2
FF Description: Snowflakes are amazing creations of nature.  They seem
to have intricate detail no matter how closely you look
at them.  One way to model a snowflake is to use a
<i>FFact(fractal)</i> which is any mathematical object showing
"self-similarity" at all levels.

<P>
The Koch snowflake is constructed as follows.
Start with a line segment.  Divide it into 3
equal parts.  Erase the middle part and substitute
it by the top part of an equilateral triangle.
Now, repeat this procedure for each of the 4
segments of this second stage.
See FFig(1).  If you continue repeating this
procedure, the curve will never self-intersect,
and in the limit you get a shape known as the
<i>Koch snowflake</i>.

<P>
Amazingly, the Koch snowflake is a curve of
infinite length!

<P>And, if you start with an equilateral triangle
and do this procedure to each side, you will
get a snowflake, which has finite area, though
infinite boundary!



Presentation suggestions: Draw pictures.  If they like this Fun Fact, ask them:
can you figure out how to construct a 3-dimensional
example?  [Hint: start with a regular tetrahedron.
See FFact(Koch+Tetrahedron) for what happens.]



Behind the fact: You can see that the boundary of the snowflake has infinite
length by looking at the lengths at each stage of
the process, which grows by 4/3 each time the process
is repeated.  On the other hand, the area inside the
snowflake grows like an FFact(infinite series),
which is geometric and converges to a finite area!
You can learn about fractals in a course on
FFact(dynamical systems).
