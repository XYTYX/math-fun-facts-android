Title: Reuleaux Wheel

Subject: 2, 3

FF Description: A <i>Reuleaux Triangle</i> is a plump triangle with
rounded edges, formed in the following way: take the
three points at the corners of an equilateral triangle,
and connect each pair of points by a circular arc
centered at the remaining point.

<P>
This triangle has some amazing properties.
It is <i>constant-width</i>, meaning that it will
hug parallel lines as it rolls.  By rotating the
centroid of the Reuleaux triangle appropriately,
the figure can be made to trace out a square,
perfect except for slightly rounded corners!

<P>
This idea has formed the basis of a drill that will
carve out squares!

<P>
And, what do you think the
ratio of its circumference to its width is?

<P>
Amazing fact:  it is PI!






Presentation suggestions: Have students think about why this figure is constant
width.




Behind the fact: There are many other FFact(convex), constant-width figures, such
as the circle and various Reuleaux FFact(polygons), and they
all satisfy the same ratio of FFact(circumference) to width!
