Title: Four Color Theorem
Keywords: graph theory, coloring problems
Subject: 4
Level: 1
FF Description: Are four colors always enough to color any map so
that no two countries that share a border
(in more than single points) have the same color?

<P>
It is easy to show that you need <i>at least</i>
four colors, because FFig(1) shows a map with four
countries, each of which is touching the other.  But
is four sufficient for any map?

<P>
Francis Guthrie made this conjecture in 1852, but
it remained unproven until 1976, when
Wolfgang Haken and Kenneth Appel showed that it
was true!

<P> Also, quite interestingly, this proof required the
assistance of a computer to check 1,936 different cases
that every other case can be reduced to!
To date no one knows a quick short proof of this theorem.




Presentation suggestions: Draw a few pictures to illustrate why the problem is
difficult, and why (as some might ask)
it is not valid to try to
"check by example".




Behind the fact: By the way, showing that five colors is sufficient
is relatively easy, and was proved in 1890.  The ideas involved in
this and the four color theorem come from FFact(graph theory):
each map can be represented by a graph in which each country is a node,
and two nodes are connected by an edge if they share a common border.

The four color theorem is true for maps on a plane or
a sphere.  The answer is different for geographic maps
on a FFact(torus); it turns out that
7 colors is necessary and sufficient then...
