Title: Proofs without Words
Keywords: 
Subject: 1, 4, 8
Level: 1
FF Description: There are many facts which can be proved just by looking
at a picture!  For instance:
<CENTER>
x<sup>2</sup> - y<sup>2</sup> = (x+y) (x-y)
</CENTER>
<BR>
is illustrated in FFig(1).
At left is a large square (of side length x) with a small square (of side length y) cut out of the corner.  (Thus its total area is x<sup>2</sup> - y<sup>2</sup>).

<p>
This figure can be cut into blue and green rectangles, and by rearranging them,
we can form a rectangle of side lengths (x-y) and (x+y), on the right side of FFig(1)!



Presentation suggestions: Write down the identity and then draw the picture, asking
students to see if they can figure out how the picture
explains the identity.  Or, draw the picture and ask if
they can figure out what it should prove!

<P>You might challenge students to take any algebraic FFact(identity)
that they know and develop a proof without words.



Behind the fact: Almost any "Proof without Words" from Mathematics Magazine
or Nelsen's recent book (see reference) will serve as
a short, snappy Fun Fact!
