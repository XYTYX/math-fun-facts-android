FF Description: Are there any real numbers that are NOT <i>algebraic</i>, i.e., expressible as the root of a non-zero FFact(polynomial) with integer coefficients?

<p>
In fact, not only are there infinitely many, there uncountably many
<i>FFact(transcendental)</i> numbers, as they are called.
This may be seen by noting there are only FFact(countably) many polynomials
with integer coefficients (each having finitely many roots),
but there are uncountably many real numbers.
But finding an explicit example of such a number is not easy!

<p>
Here is one such number, called a <i>Liouville number</i>---it has a decimal expansion with a 1 in every factorial-numbered position, and 0 in every other position:
<center>
L = 0.110001000000000000000001000000...
</center>
<br>
So it is the FFact(infinite sum)
of 10<sup>-n!</sup> for positive whole numbers n.

<p>
What a crazy number!

Presentation suggestions: 
Behind the fact: We can sketch why this Liouville number L can't be the root of a polynomial p(x) with integer coefficients.  For the sake of an example, suppose
p(x) is a cubic polynomial.

<p>
In the infinite sum expression for L,
let L<sub>n</sub> be the n-th partial sum,
e.g., L<sub>n</sub> truncates L at the n!-th decimal place.

<p>
Now write p(x)=f(x)-g(x) where f and g have only non-negative coefficients.
As f(x) is at most a cubic, write L=L<sub>n</sub>+E.  Note that L<sub>n</sub> terminates after the n!-th decimal place, but E is approximately 10<sup>-(n+1)!</sup>.  So the cube of L<sub>3</sub>,
which terminates after (3n!) places, will not interact with E in its decimal expansion.  So choose n large enough (bigger than N, say) so that the coefficients of f(x) will not cause L<sub>n</sub> and E to interact.

<p>
Thus f(L) will agree with f(L<sub>n</sub>) on its first 3n! digits.
And a similar situation holds for g(L) and g(L<sub>n</sub>).
Thus if p(L) were 0, then f(L)=g(L), and since they agree on their first 3n! digits, we'd see f(L<sub>n</sub>)=g(L<sub>n</sub>)
for <i>every</i> n > N.

<p>
But that would imply that p(x)=f(x)-g(x) has infinitely many roots, a FFact(contradiction), as it is was a non-zero polynomial!

<p>
Liouville found the first transcendental number in 1844.
The first non-contrived demonstration of a transcendental number was Lindemann's 1882 proof that Pi is transcendental.
