There's a trick to doing this quickly.
Can you see a pattern in these multiplications?
<P>
<CENTER>
42 x 48 = 2016<BR>
43 x 47 = 2021<BR>
44 x 46 = 2024<BR>
54 x 56 = 3024<BR>
64 x 66 = 4224<BR>
61 x 69 = 4209<BR>
111 x 119 = 13209<BR>

In each pair above, the numbers being multiplied
are <i>complementary</i>: they are the same number except
for the rightmost digit, and the rightmost digits
add to 10.
<P>The trick to multiplying complementary pairs is
to take the rightmost digits and multiply them;
the result forms the two rightmost digits of the answer.
(So in the last example 1 x 9 = 09.)
Then take the first number without its rightmost digit,
and multiply it by the next higher whole number;
the result forms the initial digits of the answer.
(So in the last example: 11 x 12 = 132.  Voila!
The answer is 13209.)





Presentation suggestions: 
Behind the fact: This trick works because you are multiplying pairs of numbers
of the form 10*N+A and 10*(N+1)-A, where N is a whole number and A is a digit between 1 and 9.
A little algebra shows their product is:
<P>
<CENTER>
100*N*(N+1) + A*(10-A).
</CENTER>
<P>
The first term in the sum is a multiple of 100
and it does not interact with the last two digits of sum,
which is never more than two digits long.
<P>
This trick is related to some of the other FFact(lightning+arithmetic) Fun Facts.
