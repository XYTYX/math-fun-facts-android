Title: Misleading Sequence

FF Description: Place n points along a FFact(unit circle), in such a way that
when you draw all lines connecting every pair of points,
no more than two lines pass through any interior point.
How many regions does this divide the unit disk into?
<!--needs picture-->

<P>Let's see:<BR>
For n=1, you get 1 region.<BR>
For n=2, you get 2 regions.<BR>
For n=3, you get 4 regions.<BR>
For n=4, you get 8 regions.<BR>
For n=5, you get 16 regions.<BR>

<P>See a pattern?

<P>Yes, but if you conjecture that n points produces
2<sup>n-1</sup> regions, you would be wrong!




Presentation suggestions: Draw some pictures and have students form a FFact(conjecture).
This is a good example for stressing why proofs are
so important for mathematicians.




Behind the fact: The correct answer is a little more subtle:
it is the sum of the
first 5 binomial coefficients for power (n-1):
<CENTER>
<BR>
((n-1) CHOOSE 0) +
((n-1) CHOOSE 1) +
((n-1) CHOOSE 2) +
((n-1) CHOOSE 3) +
((n-1) CHOOSE 4).
</CENTER>
<BR>
See the reference for an explanation of where this
formula comes from.  This yields 31 regions for n=6,
57 regions for n=7, 99 regions for n=8.
