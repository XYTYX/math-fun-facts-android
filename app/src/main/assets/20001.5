FF Description: <P> Are there FFact(infinitely many primes)?
<P> We'll give a proof, due to Euclid, to show that there must be infinitely many primes.  We will show that if there were only finitely many primes, it would lead to a contradiction.
<P> First note that if two numbers differ by one, then they cannot have any common factors (or else that common factor would also divide 1).
<P> So now suppose there are only finitely many primes
p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>n</sub>. Then
by multiplying them all together, we get a (very large!)
integer N that must be divisible by <I>all</I> the primes.
But then (N+1) cannot be divisible by any prime, because N and N+1 have no common factors.
This is clearly impossible because it contradicts the fact that every integer greater than 1 can be factored into primes.







Presentation suggestions: Give a simple example: suppose 2, 3, and 5 were the only
primes.  Then (2)(3)(5)+1=31 cannot be divisible by any of
them and must be divisible by some other prime number (in this
case 31) which shows that 2, 3, 5 could not be the complete
set of primes.

<P>
Note that this proof does not say that N+1 necessarily itself must be a prime... it just shows that it must be divisible by one that was not in the original list.





Behind the fact: Proving a statement by showing that its negation leads to
a contradiction is called a <I>FFact(proof by contradiction)</I>.
