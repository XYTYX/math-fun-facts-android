Title: Lucas' Theorem

Subject: 4, 5

FF Description: Lucas' Theorem: If p is a prime number, and
N has base p representation
(a<sub>j</sub>,...,a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>0</sub>) and
k has base p representation
(b<sub>j</sub>,...,b<sub>1</sub>,b<sub>0</sub>),
then (N CHOOSE k) is congruent [mod p] to
<center>
<BR>
(a<sub>j</sub> CHOOSE b<sub>j</sub>)...(a<sub>1</sub> CHOOSE b<sub>1</sub>)(a<sub>0</sub> CHOOSE b<sub>0</sub>).
</center>

<P>
Example: Let N = 588, k = 277, p = 5.
<BR>
N = 588 has base 5 representation (4323).
<BR>
k = 277 has base 5 representation (2102).
<BR>
Thus by Lucas' Theorem,
(588 CHOOSE 277) is congruent [mod 5] to
<center>
(4 CHOOSE 2) (3 CHOOSE 1) (2 CHOOSE 0) (3 CHOOSE 2)
</center>
which is 54 = 4 [mod 5].

<P>
Fun Corollary: If p is prime and N has base p representation
(a<sub>j</sub>,...,a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>0</sub>),
then there are exactly
(1+a<sub>j</sub>)...(1+a<sub>1</sub>)(1+a<sub>0</sub>)
values of k for which (N CHOOSE k) is NOT a multiple of p.
This is the number of non-multiples of p in the
N-th row of FFact(Pascal's+Triangle).

<P>
Example: Since 588 = (4323) in base 5, then
(588 CHOOSE k) is a non-multiple of 5 for exactly
5*4*3*4 = 240 values of k. The 588th row of
Pascal's Triangle will have 589 - 240 = 349
multiples of 5.

<P>
A special case of this
is FFact(Odd+Numbers+in+Pascal's+Triangle).

Behind the fact: The proof of Lucas' Theorem is based on this observation:
for p prime and r > 0, (p<sup>r</sup> CHOOSE k)
is a multiple of p for all 0 < k < p<sup>r</sup>.

To show this, note for 0 < k < N that
(N CHOOSE k) = (N/k)(N-1 CHOOSE k-1). So when
N = p<sup>r</sup>, we have
<center>
k*(p<sup>r</sup> CHOOSE k)
= p<sup>r</sup> (p<sup>r</sup>-1 CHOOSE k-1).
</center>
At least r powers of p divide the right side
of the equation above,
whereas at most r-1 powers of p divide k. Thus p must
divide (p<sup>r</sup> CHOOSE k).
(Note this argument only works when p is prime.)

<P>
When k = 0 or p<sup>r</sup>, then
(p<sup>r</sup> CHOOSE k)=1.
Otherwise (p<sup>r</sup> CHOOSE k)=0 [mod p].
Then the binomial theorem shows that when p is prime,
<center>
(1+x)<sup>p^r</sup> = 1 + x<sup>p^r</sup> [mod p].
</center>
(This is sometimes called the "Freshman Binomial Theorem".)

<P>
Now we show that (588 CHOOSE 277) is congruent to 54 [mod 5].
The general case is similar.
In the polynomial (1+x)<sup>588</sup>,
the coefficient of x<sup>277</sup>
will be (588 CHOOSE 277) [mod 5].
But
<center>
(1+x)<sup>588</sup>
= (1+x)<sup>4(125)</sup> (1+x)<sup>3(25)</sup>
(1+x)<sup>2(5)</sup> (1+x)<sup>3</sup>
</center>
and our observation above shows that
this is congruent [mod 5] to
<center>
(1+x<sup>125</sup>)<sup>4</sup>
(1+x<sup>25</sup>)<sup>3</sup>
(1+x<sup>5</sup>)<sup>2</sup>
(1+x)<sup>3</sup>.
</center>
Now how can we create an x<sup>277</sup> term?
Only by using exactly
two x<sup>125</sup> terms,
one x<sup>25</sup>,
no  x<sup>5</sup> terms, and
two x<sup>1</sup> terms. How many
ways can we do that? Exactly
(4 CHOOSE 2)(3 CHOOSE 1)(2 CHOOSE 0)(3 CHOOSE 2)
ways, as predicted!

<!--
Proof of Fun Corollary: Notice that for 0 <= b <= a < p,
(a \choose b) is not a multiple of p. Thus the only way to
obtain a multiple of p to have b_i > a_i in one of the of
(a_i choose b_i) terms. Hence given that N and k have base p
representations (a_j,...,a_1,a_0) and (b_j,...b_1,b_0),
(where we allow b_j to be 0), then in order
to obtain a non-multiple of p for (N \choose k)
it is necessary and sufficient for 0 <= b_i <= a_i for all
i = 0..j. Thus there are (1+a_j) * ... * (1+a_1) * (1+a_0)
values of $k$ that create a non-multiple of p.
