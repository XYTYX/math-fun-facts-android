FF Description: Fibonacci numbers exhibit striking patterns.  Here's one
that may not be so obvious, but is striking when you see it.
Recall the FFact(Fibonacci) numbers:
<P>
<font face="courier" size="-1">
 n: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7,  8,   9, 10, 11,  12,  13,  14,...
<BR>
f<sub>n</sub>: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377,...
</font>
<P>
Now let's look at some of their greatest common divisors (gcd's):
<CENTER>
gcd(f<sub>10</sub>,f<sub>7</sub>)
= gcd(55, 13) = 1 = f<sub>1</sub>
<BR>
gcd(f<sub>6</sub>,f<sub>9</sub>)
= gcd(8, 34) = 2 = f<sub>3</sub>
<BR>
gcd(f<sub>6</sub>,f<sub>12</sub>)
= gcd(8, 144) = 8 = f<sub>6</sub>
<BR>
gcd(f<sub>7</sub>,f<sub>14</sub>)
= gcd(13, 377) = 13 = f<sub>7</sub>
<BR>
gcd(f<sub>10</sub>,f<sub>12</sub>)
= gcd(55, 144) = 1 = f<sub>2</sub>
</CENTER>
<P>
Do you see the pattern?  The greatest common divisor
of any two Fibonacci numbers is also a Fibonacci number!
Which one?  If you look even closer, you'll see the
amazing general result:
<P>
<CENTER>
gcd(f<sub>m</sub>,f<sub>n</sub>) = f<sub>gcd(m,n)</sub>.
</CENTER>












Presentation suggestions: After presenting the general result, go back to the
examples to verify that it holds.  You may wish to prepare
a transparency beforehand with a table of Fibonacci
numbers on it, so you can refer to it throughout
the presentation.












Behind the fact: The proof is based on the following lemmas which are
interesting in their own right. All can be proved by
FFact(induction).
<BR>
a) gcd(f<sub>n</sub>, f<sub>n-1</sub>) = 1, for all n
<BR>
b) f<sub>m+n</sub>
= f<sub>m+1</sub> f<sub>n</sub>
+ f<sub>m</sub> f<sub>n-1</sub>
<BR>
c) if m divides n, then f<sub>m</sub>
divides f<sub>n</sub>
<BR>
and the ever important Euclidean Algorithm which states:
if n=qm+r, then gcd(n,m)=gcd(m,r).  For such n,m we have
<center>
gcd(f<sub>m</sub>,f<sub>n</sub>)
= gcd(f<sub>m</sub>,f<sub>qm+r</sub>)
= gcd(f<sub>m</sub>,f<sub>qm+1</sub>f<sub>r</sub>+f<sub>qm</sub>f<sub>r-1</sub>)
= gcd(f<sub>m</sub>,f<sub>qm+1</sub>f<sub>r</sub>)
= gcd(f<sub>m</sub>,f<sub>r</sub>)
</center>
<br>
where the 2nd equality follows from (b),
the 3rd equality from (c) noting that m divides qm,
and the 4th equality from noting that
f<sub>m</sub> divides f<sub>qm</sub>
which is relatively prime to f<sub>qm+1</sub>.
Thus
<center>
gcd(f<sub>n</sub>,f<sub>m</sub>)=gcd(f<sub>m</sub>,f<sub>r</sub>)
</center>
<br>
which looks a lot like the Euclidean algorithm but with f's
on top!
For example since gcd(100,80)=gcd(80,20)=gcd(20,0)=20, then
gcd(f<sub>100</sub>,f<sub>80</sub>)=gcd(f<sub>80</sub>,f<sub>20</sub>)=gcd(f<sub>20</sub>,f<sub>0</sub>=0)=f<sub>20</sub>.
