Title: Isoperimetric Inequality
Keywords: geometry
Subject: 2
Level: 2
FF Description: What's the largest volume that can be enclosed by a bubble of surface area A?

<P>
If V is the volume of a closed, three-dimensional region, and A is its surface area, then the following inequality always holds!
<CENTER>
<BR>
36 Pi * V<sup>2</sup> <= A<sup>3</sup>.
</CENTER>
</BR>
This <i>isoperimetric inequality</i> constrains how large the volume can be.
You'll note that this inequality is maximized
when the bounding surface is a sphere!

<P>
You might also note that if V is fixed, then this inequality constrains
how small the surface area A can be.
A bubble actually tries to minimize its FFact(surface area),
which is why they tend to be spherical.





Presentation suggestions: All students "know" that the area enclosed by a plane curve
of a given perimeter is maximized when the curve is a
circle. Other closed curves of the same perimeter ("iso"-"perimeter")
enclose less area.  The result quoted above is a 3-dimensional version.
<!--
Said volume can be no more than
(1/6)[1/(pi)^(1/2) ] A^(3/2).
-->



Behind the fact: The proof of the inequality in three dimensions is beyond
an elementary course, but it is discussed in Chapter 7 of
the Courant and Robbins reference.  They give
a proof of the planar result
that does not involve the variational calculus.
The Honsberger reference gives a nice short proof of the
isoperimetric inequality in two dimensions.
