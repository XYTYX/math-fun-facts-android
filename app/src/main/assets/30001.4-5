Title: Odd Numbers in Pascal's Triangle
Keywords: 
Subject: 4, 5
Level: 3
FF Description: FFact(Pascal's+Triangle) has many surprising patterns and
properties.  For instance, we can ask:
"how many odd numbers are in row N of Pascal's Triangle?"
For rows 0, 1, ..., 20, we count:
<P>
row N: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
<BR>
odd #s: 1 2 2 4 2 4 4 8 2 4 04 08 04 08 08 16 02 04 04 08 04

<P>
It appears the answer is always a power of 2.
In fact, the following is true:
<UL>
THEOREM: The number of odd entries in row N of Pascal's
Triangle is 2 raised to the number of 1's in the binary
expansion of N.
</UL>
Example: Since 83 = 64 + 16 + 2 + 1 has binary expansion
(1010011), then row 83 has 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 odd numbers.







Presentation suggestions: Prior to the class, have the students try to discover
the pattern for themselves, either in HW or in group
investigation.














Behind the fact: Our proof makes use of the binomial theorem and
modular arithmetic.  The binomial theorem says that
<center>
(1+x)<sup>N</sup> = SUM<sub>k=0 to N</sub>
(N CHOOSE k) x<sup>k</sup>.
</center>
If we reduce the coefficients mod 2, then it's easy to
show by induction on N that for N >= 0,
<center>
(1+x)<sup>2^N</sup> = (1+x<sup>2^N</sup>)   [mod 2].
</center>
<!--
[The induction step looks like:
(1+x)^{2^{N+1}}= (1+x)^{2^N}(1+x)^{2^N} = (1+x^{2^N})(1+x^{2^N})
= 1 + 2x^{2^N} + x^{2^{N+1}} = 1 + x^{2^{N+1}}  (Mod 2).]
-->

Thus:
<center>
(1+x)<sup>10</sup>
= (1+x)<sup>8</sup> (1+x)<sup>2</sup>
= (1+x<sup>8</sup>)(1+x<sup>2</sup>)
= 1 + x<sup>2</sup> + x<sup>8</sup> + x<sup>10</sup>  [mod 2].
</center>
Since the coefficients
of these polynomials are equal [mod 2], using the
binomial theorem we see that
(10 CHOOSE k) is odd for
k = 0, 2, 8, and 10; and it is even for all other k.
Similarly, the product
<center>
(1+x)<sup>11</sup>
= (1+x<sup>8</sup>)(1+x<sup>2</sup>)(1+x<sup>1</sup>)
[mod 2]
</center>
is a polynomial containing 8=2<sup>3</sup> terms, being
the product of 3 factors with 2 choices in each.
<!--
It contains an x<sup>k</sup> term for only those k
that can be created using
at most one 1, 2, and 8. There 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 of these, namely
0, 1, 2, 8, 1+2, 1+8, 2+8, and 1+2+8.
-->

<P>
In general, if N can be expressed as the sum of
p distinct powers of 2, then (N CHOOSE k) will be odd
for 2<sup>p</sup> values of k.
But p is just the number of 1's in the binary
expansion of N, and (N CHOOSE k) are the numbers in
the N-th row of Pascal's triangle. QED.

or modular arithmetic, see the reference.
