Title: Finding the N-th digit of Pi
Keywords: number theory, computational mathematics
Subject: 5
Level: 2
FF Description: Here is a very interesting formula for pi, discovered by
David Bailey, Peter Borwein, and Simon Plouffe in 1995:
<center>
<br>
Pi = SUM<sub>k=0 to infinity</sub> 16<sup>-k</sup>
[ 4/(8k+1) - 2/(8k+4) - 1/(8k+5) - 1/(8k+6) ].
</center>
<br>
The reason this pi formula is so interesting is because
it can be used to calculate the N-th digit of Pi (in base 16)
<i>without having to calculate all of the previous digits</i>!

<P>Moreover, one can even do the calculation
in a time that is essentially linear in N,
with memory requirements only logarithmic in N.
This is far better than previous algorithms for
finding the N-th digit of Pi, which required keeping track of
all the previous digits!


Presentation suggestions: You might start off by asking students how they might
calculate the 100-th digit of pi using one of the other
FFact(pi.formula)s they have learned.  Then show them
this one...


Behind the fact: Here's a sketch of how the BBP formula can be used to
find the N-th hexadecimal digit of Pi.
For simplicity, consider just the
first of the sums in the expression, and multiply this by
16<sup>N</sup>.  We are interested in the fractional part
of this expression.  The numerator of a given term
in this sum is 16<sup>N-k</sup>, and it can
be evaluated very easily mod (8k+1) using a binary
algorithm for exponentiation.  Division by (8k+1)
is straightforward via floating point arithmetic.
Not many more than N terms of this sum need be evaluated,
since the numerator decreases very quickly as k gets large
so that terms become negligible.
The other sums in the BBP formula are handled similarly.
This yields the hexadecimal expansion of Pi starting at the
(N+1)-th digit.  More details can be found in the
Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe reference.

<P>
The BBP formula was discovered using the
PSLQ Integer Relation Algorithm.  However, the
Adamchik-Wagon reference
shows how similar relations can be discovered in a way
that the proof accompanies the discovery, and gives
a 3-term formula for a base 4 analogue of the BBP result.
