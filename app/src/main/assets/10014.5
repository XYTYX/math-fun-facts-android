Title: Repunit Fun

FF Description: A <i>repunit</i> is a whole number consisting of only 1's, such as 1, 111, or 111111111.  (It's like a <i>rep</i>eating <i>unit</i>.)

<P>
These numbers have some fun properties.  For instance, many have already noted that the square of a repunit exhibits a nice pattern:
<center>
111*111 = 12321,
<p>
1111*1111 = 1234321,
<p>
11111*11111 = 123454321,
</center>
<br>
though this pattern is somewhat messed up by carrying digits when the repunit size is bigger than 9.

<P>
Here's another less well known pattern:
<center>
<p>
222+(333)<sup>2</sup> = 111111,
<p>
2222+(3333)<sup>2</sup> = 11111111,
<p>
22222+(33333)<sup>2</sup> = 1111111111.
</center>
<br>
You might see if you can figure out why.

Presentation suggestions: Can you find other cool properties of repunits?

Behind the fact: This property and many such properties can be proved by writing an n-digit repunit as:
<center>
(10<sup>n</sup> - 1 )/9
</center>
<br>
which follows from noting the repunit is a sum of a geometric series with ratio 10.  For n=4, this is just the identity 1111 = 9999/9.
