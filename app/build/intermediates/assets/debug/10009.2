Title: Napoleon's Theorem
Keywords: 
Subject: 2
Level: 1
FF Description: Take any generic triangle, and construct equilateral
triangles on each side whose side lengths are the same
as the length of each side of the original triangle.

<P>Surprise:  the centers of the equilateral triangles
form an FFact(equilateral triangle)!


Presentation suggestions: Show the truth of the statement using some extreme cases
for the initial triangle
(a particularly instructive example is a triangle
with one sidelength very close to zero).

Behind the fact: This theorem is credited to Napoleon, who was fond
of mathematics, though many doubt that he knew enough
math to discover it!
