FF Description: <!--
<P> Consider the triangle:
<BR> ....1....
<BR> ...1.1...
<BR> ..1.2.1..
<BR> .1.3.3.1.
<BR> ............. (that continues in this fashion,
where each entry is the sum of the 2 entries above it).
-->

Consider the triangle in FFig(1),
called <i>Pascal's triangle</i>.
It consists of numbers where each entry is the sum of the two entries above it.

<P> Do you recognize the numbers in each row?
This a quick way to generate the coefficients of
(x+y)<sup>n</sup> from algebra!

<P> And, better yet, you can use them as a quick way to
calculate the powers of 11, since 11=10+1.
Notice that 11, 121, 1331, and 14641
are all powers of 11...








Presentation suggestions: Draw several rows.  Ask what 11<sup>4</sup> and
11<sup>5</sup> are!
As a challenge, 11<sup>6</sup> is harder; you have
to carry...




Behind the fact: The generation of Pascal's triangle works because in long
multiplication of a polynomial by (x+y), you end up adding
adjacent coefficients of the FFact(polynomial) together.
The Fun Fact FFact(Multiplication+By+11) is based on this idea.
