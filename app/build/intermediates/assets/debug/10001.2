Title: Pizza Slices
Keywords: geometry
Subject: 2
Level: 1
FF Description: Take a pizza and pick an arbitrary point in it.
Suppose you cut the pizza into 8 slices by cutting at
45 degree angles through that point, and color the
alternate pieces red and green.

<P>Surprising theorem: the total area of the red slices and the
total area of the green slices will always be the same!

<P>In fact, this theorem is true if the number of slices is any multiple of 4 except for 4, and the slices are cut by using equal angles through a fixed arbitrary point in the pizza.

<P>Alternatively, if instead of equal angles, you use
equal-length arcs on the circumference and slice from a fixed arbitrary point in the pizza, the conclusion still holds if the number of slices is even and greater than 2.

Presentation suggestions: Draw a few pictures to illustrate some special cases.





Behind the fact: The theorem can be proved by using FFact(calculus) and
FFact(polar coordinates).  The reference gives background and
generalizations.
