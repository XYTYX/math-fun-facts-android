Title: Powers of Ten in Base Two and Five
Keywords: 
Subject: 5, 8
Level: 1
FF Description: Make two lists; one consists of all powers of 10
in base 2, and the other all powers of 10 in base 5.
(Powers of 10 are 10, 100, 1000, etc.)

<P>
Fun Fact: for any integer N > 1, there is exactly one
number in exactly one of the lists that is exactly
N FFact(digits) long!


Presentation suggestions: Show students the first terms in each list: they are
<BR>(base 2) 1010, 1100100, 1111101000, ...
<BR>(base 5) 20, 400, 13000, 310000, ...


Behind the fact: This fact is quite startling when you first see it.
Proving it makes a great exercise for a Putnam
problem-solving seminar...
