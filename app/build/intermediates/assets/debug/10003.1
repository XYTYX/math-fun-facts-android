Title: Squares Ending in 5
Keywords: lightning arithmetic
Subject: 1
Level: 1
FF Description: Give me any 2 digit number that ends in 5, and I'll square
it in my head!
<BR>
45<sup>2</sup> = 2025
<BR>
85<sup>2</sup> = 7225, etc.

<P>
There's a quick way to do this:  if the first digit is N
and the second digit is 5, then the last 2 digits of the
answer will be 25, and the preceding digits will be N*(N+1).




Presentation suggestions: After telling the trick, have students see how fast they can
square such numbers in their head, but doing several examples.


Behind the fact: You may wish to assign the proof as a fun homework
exercise: multiply (10N+5)(10N+5) and interpret!
The trick works for larger numbers, too, although it may
be harder to do this in your head.  For instance
205<sup>2</sup> = 42025,
since 20*21=420.  Also, you can combine this trick with
other FFact(lightning arithmetic) tricks.  So
115<sup>2</sup> = 13225,
because 11*12 = 132, using the FFact(Multiplication+by+11)
trick.

<P>
The reference also contains more secrets of fast mental calculations.
