Title: Products of Sums of Two Squares

FF Description: Here's a nice theorem due to FFact(Fibonacci), in 1202.

<P>Theorem.  If integers N and M can each be written as the
sum of two squares, so can their product!

<P>Example: since 2=1<sup>2</sup>+1<sup>2</sup>
and 34=3<sup>2</sup>+5<sup>2</sup>,
their product 68 should be expressible as the
sum of two squares.
In fact, 68=8<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>.
Is there an
easy way to figure out what squares the product will be
made of?

<P>Yes!  This all follows from the very cool formula:
<CENTER>
<BR>
(a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>)
(c<sup>2</sup>+d<sup>2</sup>) =
(ac+bd)<sup>2</sup> + (ad-bc)<sup>2</sup>.
</CENTER>












Presentation suggestions: Do a few more numerical examples before showing the cool
formula.












Behind the fact: The formula above can be checked trivially.  But there
are other ways to see why it is true.  If you know
some linear algebra, take a look at
the Fun Fact FFact(Really+Complex+Matrices), and take the
determinant of both sides of the matrix equation there.
You will get the formula above!

<P>Or, if you know about FFact(complex numbers), the
left hand side is the squared modulus of two complex numbers
and the right side is the squared modulus of their product!

<P>To see which numbers can be written as the sum of two squares,
see FFact(Sums+Of+Two+Squares).
