Keywords: arithmetic
Subject: 8
Level: 1
FF Description: <CENTER>
2 + 11 - 1 = 12.
</CENTER>

<P>
FFig(1) demonstrates a "proof with words"!

<!--
<CENTER>
tw<B>O</B>el<B>E</B>ve<B>N</B>   -   <B>ONE</B>
=   twelve.
</CENTER>
-->



Presentation suggestions: Write the letters for two and eleven side by side, then
cross out the letters for one as you say them.


Behind the fact: This short fun fact does not really involve any
mathematics, but it is rather amusing.
After this see also FFact(Proofs+Without+Words).
