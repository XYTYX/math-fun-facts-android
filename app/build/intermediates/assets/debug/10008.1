FF Description: Here's a quick way to square numbers between 40 and 60.  You know the squares of 40, 50, and 60, right?

<p>
So let's show what to do for N=51 through 59.  Write
N as (50+R) for R between 1 and 9.
Then N<sup>2</sup> will have first two digits (25+R) and last two digits R<sup>2</sup>.  Thus:
<center>
52<sup>2</sup>= 2704,<br>
58<sup>2</sup>= 3364,
</center>
since 27=25+2 and 33=25+8.

<p>
The rule for N=41 through 49 is similar.  Write N as (40+R) for R between 1 and 9.
Then N<sup>2</sup> will have first two digits (15+R) and last two digits (10-R)<sup>2</sup>.
So:
<center>
42<sup>2</sup>= 1764.<br>
48<sup>2</sup>= 2304.<br>
</center>


Presentation suggestions: This Fun Fact goes nicely with other FFact(lightning arithmetic) tricks, such as
FFact(Squaring+Quickly) and
FFact(Squares+Ending+in+5).
The reference gives many more secrets of mental math.

Behind the fact: These "rules" are easy to check by noting, for example, that
<center>
(50+R)<sup>2</sup> = 2500+100*R+R<sup>2</sup>.
</center>
And since (40+R)<sup>2</sup> = (50 - (10-R) )<sup>2</sup>, we have
<center>
(50 - (10-R) )<sup>2</sup>
= 2500 -100*(10-R)+(10-R)<sup>2</sup>
= 1500 +100*R+(10-R)<sup>2</sup>.
</center>
