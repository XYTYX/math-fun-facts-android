Title: Repeating Digits
Keywords: 
Subject: 5
Level: 1
FF Description: You already know that the FFact(decimal expansion) of a
rational number eventually repeats or terminates
(which can be viewed as a repeating 0).

<P>
But I tell you something that perhaps you did not know:
if the denominator of that rational number is not
divisible by 3, then the <i>repeating part of its decimal
expansion is an integer divisible by nine</i>!

<P>
Example:
<UL>
<LI> 1/7 = .142857142857...
has repeating part 142857.  This is divisible by 9.
<LI> 41/55 = .7454545...
has repeating part 45.  This is divisible by 9.
</UL>


Presentation suggestions: 
Behind the fact: This rather curious fact can be shown easily.
If the rational X is purely repeating of period P and
repeating part R, then
<CENTER>
<BR>
R = 10<sup>P</sup> X - X = (10<sup>P</sup>-1) X
= (10<sup>P</sup>-1) (m/n).
</CENTER>
<BR>
Thus R*n = (10<sup>P</sup>-1)*m is an integer.  Since
(10<sup>P</sup>-1) is divisible by 9, if n is not divisible
by 3, then R must be.  If you like these fun deductions,
you may enjoy a course in FFact(number theory)!
