Title: Fractional Dimensions
Keywords: standard Cantor set

FF Description: A point has dimension 0, a line has dimension 1,
and a plane has dimension 2.  But did you know that
some objects can be regarded to have "fractional"
dimension?

<P>
You can think of dimension of an object X
as the amount of information necessary to
specify the position of a point in X.  For instance,
a block of wood is 3-dimensional because you need
three coordinates to specify any point inside.

<P>The FFact(standard+Cantor+set) has fractional
dimension!  Why?  Well it is at most 1-dimensional,
because one coordinate would certainly specify where a
point is.  However, you can get away with "less", because
the object is self-similar.  At each stage, you only
need to specify which 2 out of 3 segments a point is in.
Mathematicians have developed a notion of "dimension"
which for the standard Cantor set works out to be:
<BR>
<CENTER>
ln(2)/ln(3) = 0.6309...
<BR>
</CENTER>
Most other "fractals" have fractional dimension;
for instance a curve whose boundary is very, very
intricate can be expected to have dimension between
1 and 2 but closer to 2.  This concept has been applied
in other sciences to describe structures that appear to
have some self-similarity, such as the coast of England
or gaseous nebulae in interstellar space.






Presentation suggestions: It makes sense to do this Fun Fact
after doing the one on
the standard FFact(Cantor set).





Behind the fact: Actually, the notion of "FFact(dimension)" can be extended to
crazy sets in many different ways.  One notion is
<i>box dimension</i>, and
another is <i>Hausdorff dimension</i>.
These notions agree for the standard Cantor set
and many other sets.
