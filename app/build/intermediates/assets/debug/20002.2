FF Description: What does a FFact(cube) look like in higher dimensions?

<P>
Well, we can extrapolate by looking at lower dimensions.
<BR>
A 0-dimensional cube is a point, a vertex.
<BR>
A 1-dimensional "cube" is a line segment, with 2 vertices
at either end.  It is obtained from a 0-dimensional cube
by thickening it in one dimension.
<BR>
A 2-dimensional "cube" is square, with 4 vertices, obtained
by thickening up the line segment in a second dimension.
<BR>
A 3-dimensional "cube" is a cube, with 8 vertices, obtained
from the square by thickening it in a third dimension.

<P>So, by extrapolation the 4-dimensional "cube", also
called a <i>tesseract</i> or <i>hypercube</i>,
should have 16 vertices, and is obtained from a cube by
thickening it up in a fourth dimension.  Since we cannot
easily visualize this, there are a number of ways we can
understand this object by viewing projections, or "shadows"
of it in 3-D.  See FFig(1).




Presentation suggestions: See if students can guess by extrapolation how many
vertices the tesseract should have.




Behind the fact: Thinking in four FFact(dimensions) is not easy, and takes practice.
However, a number of science fiction books have been
written around this idea and explain it and
possible applications quite well;
see the reference for one notable example.
