Title: Borsuk-Ulam Theorem
Keywords: topology
Subject: 7
Level: 2
FF Description: The Borsuk-Ulam theorem is another amazing theorem from
topology.  An informal version of the theorem says that
at any given moment on the earth's surface, there exist
2 antipodal points (on exactly opposite sides of the earth)
with the same temperature and barometric pressure!

<P>
More formally, it says that any FFact(continuous function) from
an <i>n</i>-sphere to R<sup><i>n</i></sup> must send a
pair of antipodal points to the same point.
(So, in the above statement, we are assuming that
temperature and barometric pressure are continuous functions.)



Presentation suggestions: Show your students the 1-dimensional version: on the equator, there must
exist opposite points with the same temperature.  Draw a few pictures of possible temperature distributions to convince them that it is true.



Behind the fact: The one dimensional proof gives some idea why the theorem
is true:  if you compare opposite points A and B on the
equator, suppose A starts out warmer than B.  As you move
A and B together around the equator, you will move A into
B's original position, and simultaneously B into A's
original position.  But by that point A must be cooler than B.  So somewhere in between (appealing to continuity) they must have been the same temperature!

<P>
On an unrelated note, the Borsuk-Ulam theorem implies
the FFact(Brouwer+fixed+point+theorem),
and there's an elementary proof!  See the reference.
