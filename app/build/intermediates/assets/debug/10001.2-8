FF Description: The digits of Pi are fascinating.
As the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter,
Pi has such a fundamental definition, and yet
this ratio is irrational and so its decimal expansion never repeats.  It is easy to be mesmerized by the digits of the decimal expansion:

and many people have tried to memorize digits of pi for fun.
<P>
One fun way to memorize the first few digits is to use
sentence mnemonics for pi--- phrases in which
the number of letters of each successive word
corresponds to a digit of pi.
Here are some well-known pi mnemonics:

<P>
<I>
"Wow! I made a great discovery!"  (3.14159...)
<P>
"Can I have a small container of coffee?"  (3.1415926...)
<P>
"How I want a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics."  (3.14159265358979...)

Presentation suggestions: For more fun on Pi, see also FFact(Pi+Approximations) and
FFact(Finding+the+N-th+digit+of+Pi).





Behind the fact: It is fun to try writing your own story or poem as a pi mnemonic.
One decision you'll have to make is how to deal with 0's
in the decimal expansion of pi (such as in the 32nd decimal place).  Some choose to use a 10-letter word to represent a zero.  Others choose to use  non-period punctuation.
