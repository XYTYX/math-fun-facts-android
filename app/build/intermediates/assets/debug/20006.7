Title: Rubber Bands Stuck on a Torus
Keywords: topology
Subject: 7
Level: 2
FF Description: <!--needs picture-->
Consider a rubber tire (a torus) with a hole in it.
Suppose that there is a green rubber band stuck to
the outside of the torus that goes through the central
cylinder,
and a red rubber band pasted to the inside that stretches
around the tire.  So, if the tire were not there, the
red and green rubber bands would be linked.

<P>
Suppose now that the tire is turned inside out through
the hole.  This is a FFact(continuous) motion; so the red band is now on the outside, and the green on the inside.  Moreover, it now seems as though the red and green rubber bands may be <i>unlinked</i>!

<P>
How can this be?




Presentation suggestions: Try this fun fact only if you can draw good pictures!
Or, challenge students to try this with a physical model;
try cutting and sewing ends of a sock.




Behind the fact: You can resolve this paradox by actually
turning the object inside out.  What you find is that
the red and blue rubber bands <i>switch</i> locations;
in other words, the red band now runs through the central
cylinder rather than around it.  So there is no FFact(paradox);
the rubber bands are still linked.

<P>
Take a FFact(topology) course for more fun!
