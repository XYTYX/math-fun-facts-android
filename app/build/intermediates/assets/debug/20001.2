FF Description: <P>Remember high school geometry?
The sum of the angles of a planar FFact(triangle) is always
180 degrees or Pi radians.
However, triangles
on other surfaces can behave differently!

<P>For instance, consider a triangle on a sphere, whose
edges are "intrinsically" straight in the sense that
if you were a very tiny ant living on the sphere you
would not think the edges were bending either to the
left or right.  (Such intrinsically straight lines
are called <i>geodesics</i>.  On spheres, they correspond
to pieces of great circles whose center coincide with
the center of the sphere.)

<P>
A triangle on a sphere
has the interesting property that the sum of the angles is
<I>greater than 180</I> degrees!  And in fact, two triangles
with the same angles are not just similar
(as in planar geometry), they are actually <i>congruent</i>!
But wait, there's more: on a UNIT sphere, the AREA of
the triangle actually satisfies:
<CENTER>
<BR>
AREA of a triangle = (sum of angles) - Pi ,
</CENTER>
<BR>
where the angles are measured in radians. Cool!

<P>
Another neat fact about spherical triangles may be found
in FFact(Spherical+Pythagorean+Theorem).

Presentation suggestions: Demonstrate the assertions about angles and areas with
an example:  draw a picture of a sphere and then draw
a triangle whose vertices are at the north pole
and at two distinct points on the equator.
Here's a follow-up question for your students:
are geodesic paths always the
shortest paths between two points?


Behind the fact: Planar geometry is sometimes
called <i>flat</i> or <i>Euclidean</i> geometry.
The geometry on a sphere is an example of
a <i>spherical</i> or <i>elliptic</i> geometry</i>.
Another kind of non-Euclidean geometry
is FFact(hyperbolic+geometry).  Spherical and hyperbolic
geometries do not satify the FFact(parallel+postulate).

<P>By the way, 3-dimensional spaces can also have
strange geometries.  Our universe, for instance,
seems to have a Euclidean geometry on a local scale,
but does not on a global scale.  In much the same
way that a sphere is "curved", so that divergent
geodesics extending from the south pole will
meet again at the north pole,
Einstein suggested that 3-space is "curved" by
the presence of matter, so that light rays (which follow
geodesics) bend near very massive objects!
