Title: Sure Betting on Different Beliefs
Keywords: 
Subject: 6
Level: 3
FF Description: Alice believes that Gore will win the election
with probability 5/8.  Bob believes that Bush will
win the election with probability 3/4.

<P>Assuming that Alice and Bob are both willing to accept
any bet that gives them a positive expectation of
winning, did you know that there's a way to place bets
with both of them so that you can make money
<i>for certain</i>?

<P>
Here's what you can do.  Bet with Alice that you'll
pay her $2 if Gore wins and she'll pay you $3 otherwise.
Alice agrees because her expectation is:
$2(5/8)-$3(3/8)=$1/8.

<P>
Bet with Bob that you'll pay him $2 if Bush wins,
and he'll pay you $3 otherwise.  Bob agrees because
his expectation is $2(3/4)-$3(1/4)=$3/4.

<P>
Alice and Bob both <i>believe</i> they have
positive expectation, but
you will win for certain: if either Bush or Gore
wins, you will net a dollar!





Presentation suggestions: Students will be quite surprised by this result;
it naturally motivates them to ponder the
meaning of probabilities as measures of belief--
a "Bayesian" view of FFact(probability).





Behind the fact: In fact, as long as Alice and Bob have
<i>different</i> beliefs about the probability
of the outcomes of the election, you can design
a bet that will give both of them positive expectation
and you positive winnings!  See if you can figure out how.
