Title: Fibonacci Number Formula
Keywords: proof by induction, combinatorics, Binet's formula
Subject: 4, 5
Level: 1
FF Description: The Fibonacci numbers are generated by setting
F<sub>0</sub>=0, F<sub>1</sub>=1, and then using the
recursive formula
<CENTER>
<BR>
F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>
</CENTER>
<BR>
to get the rest.  Thus the sequence begins:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...  This sequence of  FFact(Fibonacci) numbers arises
all over mathematics and also in nature.

<P>However, if I wanted the 100th term of this sequence,
it would take
lots of intermediate calculations with the recursive
formula to get a result.  Is
there an easier way?

<P>Yes, there is an exact formula for the n-th term!
It is:
<CENTER>
<BR>
a<sub>n</sub> = [ Phi<sup>n</sup>
- (phi)<sup>n</sup> ]/Sqrt[5].
</CENTER>
<BR>
where Phi=(1+Sqrt[5])/2 is the so-called FFact(golden mean),
and phi=(1-Sqrt[5])/2 is an
associated golden number, also equal to (-1/Phi).
This formula is attributed to Binet in 1843,
though known by Euler before him.




Presentation suggestions: 
Behind the fact: The formula can be proved by induction.  It can also be proved using the FFact(eigenvalues) of a 2x2-matrix that encodes the recurrence.  You can
learn more about recurrence formulas in a fun course called
discrete mathematics.
