FF Description: If you know how to prove things by induction,
then here is an amazing fact:
<P>
Theorem.  All horses are the same color.

<P>
Proof.  We'll induct on the number of horses.
Base case: 1 horse.  Clearly with just 1 horse,
all horses have the same color.

<P>Now, for the inductive step: we'll show that
if it is true for any group of N horses,
that all have the same color, then it is true for
any group of N+1 horses.

<P>Well, given any set of N+1 horses, if you exclude
the last horse, you get a set of N horses.  By the
inductive step these N horses all have the same color.
But by excluding the <i>first</i> horse in the pack
of N+1 horses, you can conclude that the last N horses
also have the same color.  Therefore all N+1 horses
have the same color.  QED.

<P>
Hmmn... clearly not all horses have the same color.
So what's wrong with this proof by induction?




Presentation suggestions: This delightful puzzle is an excellent test of
student understanding of proofs by FFact(induction).





Behind the fact: Hint: what could be wrong?  You showed the base case.
And you showed the inductive step, right?
<P>
Well actually, the argument in the inductive step
breaks down in going from n=1 to n=2, because
the first 1 horse and the last 1 horse have no horses in
common, and therefore may not all have the same color.
