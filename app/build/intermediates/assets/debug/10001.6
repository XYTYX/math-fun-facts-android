FF Description: <P>
How many people do you need in a group to ensure at least a
50 percent probability that 2 people in the group
share a birthday?

<P>Let's take a show of hands. How many people think
30 people is enough? 60? 90? 180? 360?

<P>Surprisingly, the answer is only 23 people to have
at least a 50 percent chance of a match.
This goes up to 70 percent for 30 people, 90 percent for
41 people, 95 percent for 47 people. With 57 people
there is better than a 99 percent chance of a birthday
match!













Presentation suggestions: If you have a large class, it is fun to try to take a poll
of birthdays: have people call out their birthdays.
But of course, whether or not you have a
match proves nothing...















Behind the fact: Most people find this result surprising because they
are tempted to calculate the FFact(probability) of a birthday
match with one particular person.
But the calculation should be done over all pairs of people. Here is a trick
that makes the calculation easier.

<P>To calculate the probability of a match, calculate
the probability of no match and subtract from 1. But the
probability of no match among n people is just
<CENTER>
(365/365)(364/365)(363/365)(362/365)...((366-n)/365),
</CENTER>
where the k-th term in the product arises from considering
the probability that the k-th person in the group doesn't
have a birthday match with the (k-1) people before her.

<P>If you want to do this calculation quickly, you can
use an approximation:
note that for <i>i</i> much smaller than <i>365</i>,
the term (1-i/365) can be approximated by EXP(-i/365).
Hence, for n much smaller than 365,
the probability of no match is close to
<center>
<br>
EXP( - SUM<sub>i=1 to (n-1)</sub> i/365) = EXP( - n(n-1)/(2*365)).
</center>
<br>
When n=23, this evaluates to 0.499998 for the probability of no match.  The probability of at least one match is thus 1 minus this quantity.

<P>For still more fun, if you know some probability: to find the probability that in a given set of n people there are exactly M matches, you can use a Poisson approximation.
The Poisson distribution is usually used to model a random variable
that counts a number of "rare events", each independent and identically distributed and with average frequency lambda.

<P>

Here, the probability of a match in a given pair is 1/365.  The matches can be considered to be approximately independent.  The frequency lambda is the product of the number of pairs times the probability of a match in a pair:
(n choose 2)/365.  Then the approximate probability that there are exactly M matches is:
<center>
(lambda)<sup>M</sup> * EXP(-lambda) / M!
</center>
which gives the same formula as above when M=0 and n=-365.
