FF Description: Given a number line with equally spaced tick marks
one unit apart, we know how to measure rational lengths:
the length m/n can be obtained by dividing
a length m line segment into n equal parts
(if you like, this can be done by straightedge and compass).
A very natural question you might ask is whether
<i>all</i> lengths on the line are rational length?

<P>
The Greeks knew that this was not the case; the FFact(square+root+of+two)
is in fact irrational and can be obtained as the hypotenuse of a right triangle
with side lengths 1 and 1.
And there are other lengths (like Pi) which are irrational,
but cannot be constructed by straightedge and compass?

<P>
These numbers (representing lengths) have an ordering, thus can be associated with points along a line.  What the above remarks show is that the set rational numbers in this line has "gaps".  How does one "fill in the gaps" between the FFact(rational numbers)?

<P>
One way to do this was proposed by Dedekind in 1872, who suggested looking at "cuts".  A <i>cut</i> C is a proper subset of rational numbers 
that is non-empty, has no greatest element, and is closed to the left 
(if r is in C, then any rational q < r is also in C).

<P>
Cuts can be shown to have a natural ordering (by inclusion), a natural arithmetic, and in a very natural way "contain" an isomorphic copy
of the rational numbers (the cut associated to a rational r is the set of all rationals less than r).
But the set of cuts also contain uncountably many more elements.
The set of all such cuts is called the <i>real numbers</i>.
In effect, we have <i>constructed</i> the real numbers from the rationals!




Presentation suggestions: 
Behind the fact: The technical details are best left to a course in real analysis.  To add two cuts A and B, consider the set formed by summing one element of A with one element of B.  Products may be defined similarly (but require one to be a little more careful).  One can then show that the real numbers form a ordered field, and also satisfy the <i>least upper bound property</i>:
every non-empty subset has a least upper bound.

<p>
This construction is one way to <i>define</i> the real numbers.  This set contains a cut that "behaves like" Sqrt[2], in that when you multiply it by itself, you get the cut corresponding to 2.
