FF Description: Consider the real number that is represented by a zero and a decimal point, followed by a never-ending string of nines:
<P>
<CENTER>
0.99999...
</CENTER>
<P>
It may come as a surprise when you first learn the fact
that this real number is actually EQUAL to the integer 1.
A common argument that is often given to show this is
as follows.  If S = 0.999..., then 10*S = 9.999...
so by subtracting the first equation from the second, we get
<P>
<CENTER>
9*S = 9.000...
</CENTER>
<P>
and therefore S=1.  Here's another argument.
The number
0.1111... = 1/9,
so if we multiply both sides by 9, we obtain 0.9999...=1.











Presentation suggestions: You might also mention that by similar arguments,
every rational number with a terminating decimal expansion
has another expansion that ends in a never-ending string of 9's.
So, for instance, the rational 7/20 can be represented
as 0.35 (the same as 0.35000...) or 0.34999...





Behind the fact: When seeing these arguments,
many people feel that there is something shady going on
here.  Since they do not have a clear idea what
a FFact(decimal expansion) represents,
they cannot believe that a number can have two different representations.
<P>
We can try to clear that up by explaining what a decimal
representation means.
Recall that the digit in each place of a decimal expansion
is associated with a (positive or negative) power of 10.
The k-th place to the left of the decimal
corresponds to the power 10^k.
The k-th place to the right of the decimal
corresponds to the power 10^(-k) or 1/10^k.

<P>
If the digits in each place are multiplied by
their corresponding power of 10 and then added together,
one obtains the real number that is represented by
this decimal expansion.

<P>
So the decimal expansion 0.9999... actually represents the
infinite sum
<P>
<CENTER>
9/10 + 9/100 + 9/1000 + 9/10000 + ...
</CENTER>
<P>
which can be summed as a FFact(geometric+series)
to get 1.  Note that 1 has decimal representation 1.000...
which is just 1 + 0/10 + 0/100 + 0/1000 + ...
so if one realizes that decimal expansions are just
a code for an infinite sum, it may be less surprising
that two infinite sums can have the same sum.
<P>
Hence 0.999... equals 1.
