Title: Right Double Cone
Keywords: multivariable calculus
Subject: 3
Level: 1
FF Description: Take a solid cylinder of radius R and height 2R.
Remove the right "double cone"
which passes through the center of the solid cylinder
and extends meet the circular discs on the top and bottom
of the cylinder.  See FFig(1).

<P>
The volume of the remaining object and the volume of
a sphere of radius R are the same!



Presentation suggestions: Pictures, pictures!



Behind the fact: Using FFact(Cavalieri's principle) is perhaps the most
effective way to prove this in a FFact(multivariable calculus) course.
