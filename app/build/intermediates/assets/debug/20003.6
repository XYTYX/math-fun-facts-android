Title: Poker Probability Paradox
Keywords: poker probabilities
Subject: 6
Level: 2
FF Description: In poker, there is a hierarchy of desirable hands which
relate to how unlikely the hand is.  For instance, a
royal flush is deemed most desirable because it is least
likely to arise in play.

<P>
But what if you allow wild cards?

<P>
Clearly this creates some new hands (like 5-of-a-kind).
Allowing wild cards can also alter the hierarchy, since
some hands are now more likely than they were before.

<P>
But a real surprise (and recent discovery) is that
the following thing can occur:
no matter what hierarchy is established, the
resulting probabilities are incompatible!  In other words,
with wild cards, there are some hands that can be declared
either of two types (such as two-pair or three-of-a-kind).
But if you rank one type as more desirable than another,
that type will more commonly arise in play,
but this means it should have been less desirable!
