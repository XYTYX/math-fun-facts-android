Level: 3
FF Description: Here is an amazing formula due to FFact(Euler):
<CENTER>
<BR>
SUM<sub>n=1 to infinity</sub> n<sup>-s</sup>
= PROD<sub>p prime</sub> (1 - p<sup>-s</sup>)<sup>-1</sup> .
</CENTER>
<BR>
What's interesting about this formula is that it
relates an expression involving all the positive integers
to one involving just primes!

<P>
And you can use it to prove there must be FFact(infinitely many primes).
For, if there were only finitely many primes, then the right side of the expression is a finite product, and in particular for s=1.  But for s=1, the left side of the equation is the
FFact(harmonic series) which we know must diverge!
This is a FFact(contradiction), so there must be infinitely many primes.









Presentation suggestions: Interested students may wish to take a few terms on the
right hand side, use a power expansion, and
multiply them out... to get an idea of why the equality
holds.





Behind the fact: The left hand side, when s is viewed as a complex variable,
is also known as the FFact(Riemann+zeta+function).
Because of the above relationship, the study of
zeta functions is closely related to the study
of the FFact(distribution+of+primes)!
