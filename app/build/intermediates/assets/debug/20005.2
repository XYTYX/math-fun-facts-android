Title: One, Two, Three, Pi
Keywords: trigonometry, geometry
Subject: 2
Level: 2
FF Description: Here's an interesting formula:
<CENTER>
<BR>
Arctan(1) + Arctan(2) + Arctan(3) = Pi.
</CENTER>
<BR>
(Everything's in radians, of course).








Presentation suggestions: Challenge students to prove this fact.




Behind the fact: The Figure contains a hint;
check that the angles of the three FFact(triangles) at their
common vertex add to Pi.  Can you find a similar
proof for the following equation?
<CENTER>
<BR>
Arctan(1/2)+Arctan(1/3) = Pi/4.
