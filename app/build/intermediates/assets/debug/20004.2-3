Title: Surface Area of a Sphere
Keywords: calculus
Subject: 2, 3
Level: 2
FF Description: The area of a disk enclosed by a circle of radius R is Pi*R<sup>2</sup>.
<BR>
The formula for the circumference of a circle of radius R is 2*Pi*R.
<BR>
A simple FFact(calculus) check reveals that
the latter is the derivative of the former with respect
to R.

<P>
Similarly, the volume of a ball enclosed by a sphere of radius R is (4/3)*Pi*R<sup>3</sup>.
<BR>
And the formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius R is 4*Pi*R<sup>2</sup>.
<BR>
And, you can check that the latter is the derivative
of the former with respect to R.

<P>
Coincidence, or is there a reason?



Presentation suggestions: Let your students tell you those FFact(geometry) formulas if they
remember them.












Behind the fact: Well, no, it is not a coincidence.  For the ball,
a small change in radius produces a
change in volume of the ball which is equal to the volume
of a spherical shell of radius R and thickness (delta R).
The spherical shell's volume is thus approximately
(surface area of the sphere)*(delta R).
But the derivative is approximately the
change in ball volume divided by (delta R), which is
thus just (surface area of the sphere).

<P>
So, if I tell you the 4-dimensional "volume" of the
4-dimensional ball is (1/2)*Pi<sup>2</sup>*R<sup>4</sup>,
what is 3-dimensional volume of its boundary?

<P>
