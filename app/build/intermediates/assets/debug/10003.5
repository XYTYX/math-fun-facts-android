Title: Formula for Primes?
Keywords: prime formula, number theory
Subject: 5
Level: 1
FF Description: Is there a nice cozy formula that will always spit
out primes?  Try this one:
<center>
f(n) = n<sup>2</sup> + n + 41.
</center>
<P>
FFact(Euler) discovered that this formula has a long string of prime
values: it is prime for all n between 0 and 39 inclusive.
However, it is not prime for all
integers.  In fact, it can be shown that no
non-constant polynomial with integral coefficients will
always spit out primes at the natural numbers.

<P>
There are formulas which <i>always</i> spit out primes when you
plug in a natural number... here's one (Mills, 1947):
<center>
greatest integer less than (X raised to 3<sup>n</sup>),
</center>
<BR>
where X is approximately 1.3064...  Surprised?
See the remark below!


Presentation suggestions: 
Behind the fact: It is worth pointing out that while the formula above
looks nice, it is useless... it grows too quickly,
and to determine X is tantamount to knowing the FFact(primes)
in its range!
