Title: Connected Sums
Keywords: topology, 2-manifolds

FF Description: A surface is any object which is locally like a piece
of the plane.  A sphere, a FFact(projective+plane),
a FFact(Klein+bottle),
a torus, a 2-holed torus are all
examples of surfaces.  We do not distinguish between
a sphere and a deformed sphere... we say they are
"topologically equivalent".

<P>
You know how to add numbers.  But did you know that there is
a way to add surfaces?  It's called the "connect sum".
To connect sum two surfaces you pull out a disc
from each, creating "holes", and then sew the two surfaces together along the boundaries of the holes.  This
gives another surface!  Connect sum a 1-holed torus to
a 2-holed torus, and you get a 3-holed torus.  Connect sum
a projective plane with a projective plane, and you get a
Klein+bottle!  And, it can be shown that if you
connect sum three projective planes it is the same surface
as the connect sum of a torus and one projective plane!

<P>
The operation is commutative, associative and
there is even an identity element:  just add a sphere to
any surface and you get back that surface!

<P>
But there is no "inverse" operation:  you cannot connect
sum a torus to anything and hope to get a sphere...








Presentation suggestions: Draw some fun pictures to illustrate.








Behind the fact: This belongs to a field of mathematics
known as FFact(topology), which, loosely speaking,
is the study of FFact(continuous functions) and 
properties of objects which do not change under continuous deformations.
