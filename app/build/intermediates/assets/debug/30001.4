FF Description: We have seen in the Fun Fact
FFact(How+many+Rationals?)
that the rational numbers are FFact(countable),
meaning they have the same cardinality
as the set of natural numbers.

<P>
So are all infinite sets countable?

<P>
Cantor shocked the world by showing that the real numbers
are not countable... there are "more" of them than the
integers!  His proof was an ingenious use of a 
FFact(proof by contradiction).  

In fact, he could show that there exists infinities of many different "sizes"!






Presentation suggestions: If you have time show Cantor's diagonalization argument, which goes as follows.
If the reals were countable, it can be put in
1-1 correspondence with the natural numbers,
so we can list them
in the order given by those natural numbers.
Now use this list to construct a real number X that
differs from every number in our list in at least one
decimal place, by letting X differ from the
N-th digit in the N-th decimal place.
(A little care must be exercised to ensure
that X does not contain an infinite string of 9's.)
This gives a contradiction, because the list was supposed to contain all real numbers, including X.
Therefore, hence a 1-1 correspondence
of the reals with the natural numbers must not be possible.



Behind the fact: The theory of countable and uncountable sets came as a
big surprise to the mathematical community in the late
1800's.
<P>By the way, a similar "diagonalization" argument
can be used to show that any set S and the
set of all S's subsets (called the <i>power set</i> of S)
cannot be placed in one-to-one correspondence.
The idea goes like this: if such a correspondence
were possible, then every element A of S has a subset K(A)
that corresponds to it.  Now construct a new subset of S, call it J, such that an element A is in J if and only if
A is NOT in K(A).  This new set, by construction, can never be K(A) for any A, because it differs from every K(A) in the "A-th element".  So K(A) must not run through the entire power set of A, hence the 1-1 correspondence asserted above must not be possible.

<P>
This proof shows that there are infinite sets of
many different "sizes" 
by considering the natural numbers and its successive power sets!
The "size" of a set is called is FFact(cardinality).
