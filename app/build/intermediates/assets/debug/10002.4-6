FF Description: Did you know that whenever you shuffle a deck of cards, it is quite likely that you are making history?

<p>
A deck of 52 cards can be ordered in 52! = 52 x 51 x 50 x...x 2 x 1 ways.
This is because there are 52 ways to choose the first card, 51 ways to choose the 2nd, 50 ways to choose the 3rd, etc.  But 52! is a very large number: larger than

<p>
8 x 10<sup>67</sup>.
</p>
</center>
How big is this number?  Well, someone shuffling a deck of cards once per second since the beginning of the universe (believed to be about 14 billion years ago) would not have shuffled the deck more than 10<sup>15</sup> times.

<p>
Thus it is quite likely that any given configuration achieved through FFact(random) shuffling has never appeared before in the history of shuffling!


Presentation suggestions: You might also compare 10<sup>67</sup> to other large numbers or the number of stars in the universe (10<sup>23</sup>).





Behind the fact: We ought to be a little careful here.  In reality, there are many
kinds of shuffles and not all of them involve randomness, e.g., see the Fun Fact FFact(Perfect+Shuffles).  In order for the result of a shuffle to produce an independent configuration, we must use a shuffle with inherent randomness.

<p>
But even a single random riffle shuffle
does not make every configuration equally likely, so a single random riffle shuffle will not produce an independent ordering of cards.
However a single random riffle shuffle produces nearly 2<sup>52</sup> possible configurations,
which is still a very large number (4.5x10<sup>15</sup>), and after seven random riffle shuffles nearly every configuration is equally likely to occur,
as explained in the Fun Fact FFact(Seven+Shuffles).
So it is still very likely that each random riffle shuffle is truly "making history".
