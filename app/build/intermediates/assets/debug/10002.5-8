Title: Kaprekar's Constant
Keywords: iteration, functions, dynamical systems
Subject: 5, 8
Level: 1
FF Description: Take any four digit number
(whose digits are not all identical), and do the following:
<OL>
<LI>Rearrange the string of digits to form the
largest and smallest 4-digit numbers possible.
<LI>Take these two numbers and subtract
the smaller number from the larger.
<LI>Use the number you obtain and repeat the above
process.
</OL>
What happens if you repeat the above process over and over?
Let's see...

<P>Suppose we choose the number 3141.
<BR>4311-1134=3177.
<BR>7731-1377=6354.
<BR>6543-3456=3087.
<BR>8730-0378=8352.
<BR>8532-2358=6174.
<BR>7641-1467=6174...
<BR>
The process eventually hits 6174 and then stays there!
<P>But the more amazing thing is this: <i>every</i>
four digit number whose digits are not all the same
will eventually hit 6174, in at most 7 steps, and
then stay there!




Presentation suggestions: Remember that if you encounter any numbers with fewer than has fewer 4 digits, it must be treated as though it had 4 digits, using leading zeroes.  Example: if you start with
3222 and subtract 2333, then the difference is 0999.  The next step would then consider the difference 9990-0999=8991, and so on.

You might ask students to investigate what happens for
strings of other lengths or in other bases.






Behind the fact: Each number in the sequence uniquely determines the
next number in the sequence.  Since there are only
finitely many possibilities, eventually the sequence
must return to a number it hit before, leading to a
cycle.  So any starting number will give a FFact(sequence)
that eventually cycles.  There can be many cycles; however,
for length 4 strings in base 10, there
happens to be 1 non-trivial cycle, and it has length 1
(involving the number 6174).
