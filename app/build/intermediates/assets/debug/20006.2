Title: Spherical Pythagorean Theorem

FF Description: Did you know there is a version of the FFact(Pythagorean Theorem)
for right triangles on spheres?

<P>First, let's define precisely what we mean by a
spherical triangle.  A <i>great circle</i> on a sphere
is any circle whose center coincides with the
center of the sphere.  A <i>spherical triangle</i> is
any 3-sided region enclosed by sides that are arcs
of great circles.  If one of the corner angles is
a right angle, the triangle is
a <i>spherical right triangle</i>.

<P>In such a triangle,
let C denote the length of the side opposite
right angle.  Let A and B denote the
lengths of the other two sides.
Let R denote the radius of the sphere.
Then the following particularly nice formula holds:
<BR>
<CENTER>
cos(C/R) = cos(A/R) cos(B/R).
<BR>
</CENTER>



Presentation suggestions: <!-- needs picture of right triangle -->
Verify the formula is true in some simple examples:
such a triangle with two right angles formed by the
equator and two longitudes.  For more on
spherical triangles,
see the Fun Fact on FFact(Spherical+Geometry).



Behind the fact: This formula is called the "Spherical Pythagorean Theorem"
because the regular Pythagorean theorem can be obtained
as a special case:  as R goes to infinity, expanding the
cosines using their FFact(Taylor series) and manipulating the
resulting expression will yield:
<BR>
<CENTER>
C<sup>2</sup> = A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup>
<BR>
</CENTER>
as R goes to infinity!  This should make sense, since
as R goes to infinity, spherical geometry becomes more
and more like regular planar FFact(geometry)!

<P>By the way, there is a "hyperbolic geometry" version,
too.  Can you guess what it says?  See the reference.
