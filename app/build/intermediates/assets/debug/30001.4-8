Subject: 4, 8

FF Description: Say you and a friend wish to share a cake.
What is a "fair" way to split it?
Probably you know this solution:
one cuts, the other chooses.
This is called a <i>FFact(fair+division) algorithm</i>,
because by playing a good strategy,
each player can guarantee she gets at least
50 percent of the cake <i>in her own measure</i>.
See if you can reason why.

<P>
Now, what about for 3 people?  Is there an
algorithm that guarantees each person what she feels
is the <i>largest</i> piece?  Such a
division is called an <i>envy-free</i> division.
Here is a procedure due
to Selfridge and Conway.  We mark strategies [in brackets].
Suppose the players are named Alice, Betty, Chuck.
<ol>
<li>Alice cuts [into what she thinks are thirds].
<li>Betty trims one piece
[to create a 2-way tie for largest], and sets
the trimmings aside.
<li>Let Chuck pick a piece, then Betty, then Alice.
Require Betty to take a trimmed piece if Charlie
does not.
Call the person who tooked the trimmed piece T,
and the other (of Betty and Chuck) NT.
<li>To deal with the trimmings, let
NT cut them [into what she thinks are thirds].
<li>Let players pick pieces in this order:
T, Alice, then NT.
</ol>










Presentation suggestions: Be sure you follow the argument before you present it,
because it can be confusing!  Draw pictures.






Behind the fact: It is a good exercise to verify why each person is
envy-free by the end of the procedure.
The key observation is that for the trimmings,
Alice has an "irrevocable advantage"
with respect to T, since Alice will never envy T even
if T gets all the trimmings.  Thus Alice can pick after T,
and this allows the procedure to terminate in a
finite number of steps.
For 4 or more players, there is an envy-free
solution that is very complex, and can take arbitrarily
long to resolve.  See the references.

<P>
There are other notions of fairness besides
envy-freeness.  <i>Proportional</i> fairness is weaker;
it only demands each person gets what she feels is
at least 1/N of the cake.  You might enjoy figuring out
an N-person proportional procedure.

<P>
Questions of fairness are considered by mathematicians and economists 
in the subject of FFact(game theory).
