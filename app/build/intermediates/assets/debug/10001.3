FF Description: <P>
What is the shape of a suspended rope? Is there some
function that describes it?

<P>
Answer: it's the cosh curve!



Presentation suggestions: This may be seen quite dramatically by putting up a
transparency of the catenary
<CENTER>
y = cosh x
</CENTER>
and suspending a rope in front of the transparency projection
so that the rope shadow can be compared!

<P>
Now, someone may object and say that the curve of
x<sup>2</sup> will also
give a good approximation. If they do this, you can talk
about how the Taylor series of cosh begins with a quadratic
1 + x<sup>2</sup>/2, so it is not surprising!


Behind the fact: FFact(Calculus) and modeling are useful here: by breaking the
rope into lots of little chunks, and modeling the forces
on each chunk, one can obtain a 
FFact(differential equation) whose
solution is the cosh curve.
