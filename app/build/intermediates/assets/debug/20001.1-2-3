Title: Chords of a Unit Circle
Keywords: complex numbers, chords, unit circle

FF Description: <P>
Take N equidistant points on the unit circle. Pick one of
those points, then draw chords from it to all other points
on the circle, as in FFig(1).
What is the product of lengths of those chords?

</P>Surprise: for N points, the product is just N.
Pretty cool, huh?




Presentation suggestions: Do simple cases first and draw pictures: for N=2, there is just one chord (the diameter of the circle, length 2).  For N=3, there are two chords (both of length Sqrt[3], product=3).  For N=4, there are 3 chords (one diameter of length 2, two of length Sqrt[2], product=4).  Have people conjecture the answer for themselves!



Behind the fact: If you know about FFact(complex numbers), you can prove this by
letting the points of the circle be given by roots of
unity, and letting z be any point (not necessarily the
unit disc) and looking at the product of lengths of the chords from z to all N points on the circle.
Divide this expression by (z-1), and take the limit as z goes to 1, and voila!, you will get N.
