FF Description: <P>
Here's a calculus limerick:
<P>Integral z-squared dz
<BR>from 1 to the cube root of 3
<BR>      times the cosine
<BR>      of three pi over 9
<BR>equals log of the cube root of 'e'.

Presentation suggestions: Students may enjoy verifying the limerick's claim!

p.s. Remember that in all of FFact(calculus), the logarithm means natural log.  Oh, and for our British friends who say "z" as "zed", the "z" in this limerick should be pronounced "zee"!


Behind the fact: Students will enjoy creating their own math
FFact(limerick)s... it brings out the cultural aspect of mathematics.
