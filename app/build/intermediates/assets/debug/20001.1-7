FF Description: You are abducted by space aliens and dumped, blindfolded,
on a strange asteroid!  Removing your blindfold, you
decide to play "Columbus" by walking
in one direction forever to see if you can
determine whether your asteroid is flat or curved.
But you leave a trail of bread crumbs as you go,
just in case you get lost.

<P>
After a few hours, you return to where you started,
and rejoin the trail of bread crumbs.

<P>
You think to yourself, OK, this asteroid is curved
and probably not planar.  But then a crazy thought
enters your mind--- maybe the asteroid is shaped like
a doughnut instead of a sphere?  What
experiment could you perform to tell the difference?

<P>
You decide to walk off in a transverse direction,
leaving a trail of cheese crumbs
this time.  Suppose that after a long time you return to
your original starting point, and your cheese crumbs never
crossed the trail of bread crumbs except when you
returned.  What could you infer now?





Presentation suggestions: Pause and see if students can figure out what experiment
to perform to tell the difference between a doughnut
and a sphere.
Draw a few plausible pictures of a sphere or a doughnut,
and how our abducted explorer could have traveled.




Behind the fact: Since any two "loops" (trails of crumbs)
on a sphere which start and end at the same point must
cross somewhere in between, you cannot be living on
a sphere.  It could be a doughnut(torus) or some other
surface with more "holes".
<P>
Mathematicians often study FFact(surfaces) by their
<i>intrinsic</i> properties.  One way to study a
surface is to study the set of all loops in the surface;
this is called the <i>FFact(fundamental group)</i> and
it has an algebraic structure!  You can add loops
by concatenation, and two loops are "equal" if
one can be deformed to the other.  It turns out the
the fundamental group is "topologically invariant":
it does not change if you deform the surface.  So you
can tell two surfaces are not topologically equivalent
if they do not have the same fundamental group!

<p>
This is a fundamental idea in the field of FFact(topology).
