Title: One Equals Zero: Integral Form
Keywords: calculus, false proof, paradox
Subject: 3, 8
Level: 1
FF Description: Consider the following FFact(integral):
<CENTER>
<BR>
INTEGRAL (1/x) dx
</CENTER>
<BR>
Perform integration by parts: let
<CENTER>
<BR>
u = 1/x ,        dv = dx
<BR>
du = -1/x<sup>2</sup> dx ,      v = x
</CENTER>
<BR>
Then obtain:
<CENTER>
<BR>
INTEGRAL (1/x) dx = (1/x)*x - INTEGRAL x (-1/x<sup>2</sup>) dx
<BR> = 1 + INTEGRAL (1/x) dx
</CENTER>
<BR>
which implies that 0 = 1.

<P> What's wrong with this calculation?







Presentation suggestions: 
Behind the fact: This is common mistake using integration by parts in FFact(calculus).
Students often forget about the constant of integration
for indefinite integrals.  In this case, the constants
on both sides will differ by 1.
