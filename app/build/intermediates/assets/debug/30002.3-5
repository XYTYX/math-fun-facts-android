FF Description: If you raise an FFact(irrational number) to a rational power,
it is possible to get something rational.  For instance,
raise Sqrt[2] to the power 2 and you'll get 2.

<P>
But what happens if you raise an irrational number
to an irrational power?  Can this ever be rational?

<P>
The answer is yes, and we'll prove it <i>without
having to find specific numbers that do the trick</i>!
<UL>
Theorem.  There exist irrational numbers A and B
so that A<sup>B</sup> is rational.
</UL>
Proof.  We know that Sqrt[2] is irrational.  So, if
A=Sqrt[2] and B=Sqrt[2] satisfy the conclusion of the
theorem, then we are done.  If they do not, then
Sqrt[2]<sup>Sqrt[2]</sup> is irrational, so let A be
this number.  Then, letting B=Sqrt[2], it is easy to
verify that A<sup>B</sup>=2 which is rational and
hence would satisfy the conclusion of the theorem.
QED.
<P>

This proof is <i>FFact(non-constructive)</i> because it
(amazingly) doesn't
actually tell us whether Sqrt[2]<sup>Sqrt[2]</sup> is
rational or irrational!



Presentation suggestions: 
Behind the fact: Actually, Sqrt[2]<sup>Sqrt[2]</sup> can be shown to
be irrational, using something called the
Gelfond-Schneider Theorem (1934), which says that if A and B
are roots of polynomials, and A is not 0 or 1 and B is
irrational, then A<sup>B</sup> must be irrational
(in fact, transcendental).

<P>
But you don't need Gelfond-Schneider to construct
an explicit example, assuming you know FFact(transcendental) numbers exist
(numbers that are not roots of non-zero polynomials with
integer coefficients).
Let x be any transcendental and q be any positive rational.
Then x<sup>log_x(q)</sup>=q
so all we have to show is that log_x(q) is irrational.
If log_x(q)=a/b then q=x<sup>a/b</sup>,
implying that x<sup>a</sup>-q<sup>b</sup>=0,
contradicting the transcendentality of x.
