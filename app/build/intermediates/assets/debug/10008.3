Title: Euler's Formula
Keywords: complex analysis, calculus
Subject: 3
Level: 1
FF Description: The five most important numbers in mathematics
all appear in a single equation!
<CENTER>
<BR>
<i>e</i><sup><i>i</i>*Pi</sup> + 1 = 0.
</CENTER>
<BR>
In fact, this is a special case of the following formula,
due to Euler:
<CENTER>
<BR>
<i>e</i><sup><i>i</i>t</sup> = cos(t) + <i>i</i>*sin(t).
</CENTER>
<BR>




Presentation suggestions: This is a good Fun Fact to use after introducing
FFact(complex numbers), as it gives some intuition about
polar coordinates on C.  
However, a more interesting use is after teaching the FFact(Taylor series)
of <i>e</i>, sin , and cos.  See below.  You could
do the following in class or on a Taylor series homework
and then give the Fun Fact as the case where you set t=Pi.


Behind the fact: Introduce the "imaginary number" <i>i</i>, a number
with the property that <i>i</i><sup>2</sup>=-1.
Make sure students understand that,
say, <i>i</i><sup>5</sup>=<i>i</i>.
Take the Taylor series of <i>e</i><sup>t</sup>
and plug "it" in (that's "<i>i</i>*t").
Since <i>e</i><sup>t</sup> converges absolutely everywhere,
have them rearrange the resulting series into two series:
one with an i in each term, and one with no i's.
What are these two series?  Yes, cos(t) and i*sin(t).

<P>
This formula demonstrates a remarkable connection
between analysis
(in the form of the Taylor series of e, sin, and cos)
and geometry (the polar coordinates in C).
Heck, it's a remarkable connection between e, sin and cos!
