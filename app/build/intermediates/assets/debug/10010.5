Title: Gaps in Primes

FF Description: We know there are FFact(infinitely+many+primes),
so are many interesting questions you can
ask about the FFact(distribution+of+primes),
i.e., how they spread themselves out.
Here is something to ponder:
are there arbitrarily large "gaps"
in the sequence of primes?

<P>At first this may seem
like a tough question to tackle, since it is sometimes
tedious to determine whether a number is prime.
But it may help to look at the problem a different way:
can I find long sequences of successive integers
which are all composite?

<P>
Yes, and now it is easy to see why.
Suppose I want to find (N-1) consecutive integers that
are composite.  The number N! has, as factors, all
numbers between 1 and N.  Therefore:
<BR>
N!+2 is composite, since it is divisible by 2.
<BR>
N!+3 is composite, since it is divisible by 3.
<P>
In fact, for similar reasons,
N!+k is composite for all k between 2 and N.
This is a string of (N-1) successive integers which
are all composite.


Presentation suggestions: It may be good to warm up by asking is what the
largest prime gap less than 100.

Behind the fact: Sometimes simple deductions can lead to surprising
results!
