FF Description: How should one select the winner of an FFact(election)?

<P>If there are only two candidates,
the answer is clear--- choose the
one who would win the most votes in a head-to-head election.
But with three or more candidates, when
each voter has ranked his or her candidate preferences, the answer is less obvious.

<P>Mathematically we can formalize the question in this way.
A <i>social choice</i> function is a function that
takes lists of people's ranked preferences and outputs
a single alternative (the "winner" of the election).
So the question becomes:
is there a "good" social choice function that
represents "the will of the people"?

<P>
Consider the following situation
with 3 voters and 3 candidates:

<P>
Suppose Voter 1 prefers A to B to C.<BR>
Suppose Voter 2 prefers B to C to A.<BR>
Suppose Voter 3 prefers C to A to B.<BR>

<P>
Notice that no matter who is selected as the
"social choice" for this set of lists, then
2/3 of the voters will be "unhappy" in the sense
that those voters prefer another candidate to the one
chosen by the social choice function!
(For instance, if A is chosen as the winner, then
Voters 2 and 3 will prefer C to A.)

<P>This paradox, due to Maurice de Condorcet in 1785, shows that it is not always possible for a social choice function to pick a candidate that will beat all other candidates in pairwise comparisons.  If there is a candidate that does, then that candidate is called a <i>Condorcet winner</i>.






Presentation suggestions: This may be a good starting point for students
to ponder the role of third parties in American politics.
You may also ask students to generalize this FFact(paradox) to
N people.





Behind the fact: The study of social choice functions and related questions
is called <i>social choice theory</i>, a subfield of FFact(game theory).
There are other famous impossibility results: most notably FFact(Arrow's+Impossibility+Theorem).
