Title: Sperner's Lemma
Keywords: triangles, combinatorics
Subject: 4
Level: 2
FF Description: Divide a triangle <EM>T</EM> into lots of baby triangles,
so that baby triangles only meet at a common edge or a
common vertex. Label each main vertex of the whole
triangle by 1, 2, or 3; then label vertices on the
(12) side by either 1 or 2, on the (23) side by either
2 or 3, and the (13) side by either 1 or 3. Label the
points in the interior by any of 1, 2, or 3. For
instance, see FFig(1).
<P> Fun Fact: any such labelling must contain an
baby (123) triangle!
(In fact, there must be an <EM>odd</EM> number!)
<P> Actually, a version of Sperner's Lemma
holds in all dimensions. Can you figure out how it
generalizes?
<P>
Sperner's Lemma is equivalent to the
FFact(Brouwer+fixed+point+theorem).


Presentation suggestions: Have everyone make their own labelled triangle
and see how many (123) triangles they have in their
picture.













Behind the fact: There are many proofs of this fact.  Some short
non-constructive proofs rely on parity arguments.
Constructive proofs are the key to many fixed point
algorithms as well as FFact(fair+division) procedures.
See the reference.
