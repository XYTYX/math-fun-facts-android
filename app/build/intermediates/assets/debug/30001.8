FF Description: Two sets A and B are said to be <i>FFact(equidecomposable)</i>
if you can partition set A into a finite number of
subsets and reassemble them (by rigid motions only)
to form set B.

<P>
Let A be a unit circle, and let B be a unit circle with
one point X missing (called a "deleted circle").
Are sets A and B equidecomposable?

<P>
Believe it or not, yes!  In fact you can do it using
just 2 subsets.  Can you figure out how?


Presentation suggestions: Some students will be tempted to "push together" the
ends of the deleted circle, but this is not a rigid motion,
and because of the openness of the endpoints, the ends
will never "meet" unless they intersect.


Behind the fact: Consider set B and let U be the subset consisting
of all points that are
a positive integer number of radians clockwise from X
along the circle.  This is a countably infinite set
(the irrationality of Pi prevents two such points from
coinciding).  Let set V be everything else.

<P>If you pick set U up and rotate it
<i>counterclockwise</i> by one radian, something
very interesting happens.  The deleted
hole at X gets filled by the point 1 radian away,
and the point at the (n-1)-th radian
gets filled by the point at the n-th radian.  Every point
vacated gets filled, and in addition,
the empty point at X gets filled too!

<P>Thus, B may be decomposed into sets U and V,
which
after this reassembling, form set A, a
complete circle!

<P>
This elementary example forms the beginnings of the
idea of how to accomplish the FFact(Banach-Tarski+paradox).
