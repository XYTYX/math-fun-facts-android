Title: Sums of Two Squares
Keywords: sum of squares, number theory
Subject: 5
Level: 2
FF Description: Which whole numbers are expressible as
sums of two (integer) squares?

<P>
Here's a theorem that completely answers the question,
due to Fermat:

<BR>
A number N is expressible as a sum of 2 squares
if and only if in the prime factorization of N, every
prime of the form (4k+3) occurs an even number of times!
</P>

<P>
Examples:  245 = 5*7*7.  The only prime
of the form 4k+3 is 7, and it appears twice.  So
it should be possible to write 245 as a sum of 2 squares
(in fact, try the squares of 14 and 7).
But because 7 appears only once in 42=2*3*7, it is
impossible to write 42 as the sum of two squares.

<P>A corollary of this fact is that every prime of the
form (4k+1) can be written as the sum of two squares.


Presentation suggestions: See if your students can figure out how to write
245 as the sum of two squares, using their knowledge
from the Fun Fact FFact(Products+Of+Sums+Of+Two+Squares) and writing
5, and 49 as the sum of two squares.


Behind the fact: Well, if not every number can be written as a
sum of two squares, perhaps a larger number of squares
will suffice?  Can every number be written as the
sum of 3 or 4 squares?
See the Fun Fact
FFact(Sums+of+Three+and+Four+Squares)
for more on these questions.
