Title: Pretzel Unlinking
Keywords: 
Subject: 7
Level: 2
FF Description: Imagine that each of the
ropes in the two sets of links in FFig(1) are
solid (with thickness) and
made of very flexible and stretchy rubber.

<P>
Question: is it possible to deform
one set of links into the other in a continuous motion
(without tearing or cutting)?  In other words, can you
get the purple pretzel off the red ring?

<P>
Surprise answer: Yes!!



Presentation suggestions: Students (as well as you) may find this very hard
to believe!




Behind the fact: The transformation can best be explained by a sequence
of pictures that demonstrate the transformation, since
it is not easy to describe in words!   It is important here that the
ropes are solid, with thickness, and very stretchy; it wouldn't be possible otherwise.  See FFact(Unbelievable+Unlinking) for a hint on how it
can be done.

The reference contains a solution.

<P>A course in <i>FFact(topology)</i> is the best place to
learn about links and knots and continuous deformations.
