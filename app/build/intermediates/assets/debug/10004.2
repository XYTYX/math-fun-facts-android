FF Description: Draw a triangle, any triangle (although it may be best
to start with an acute triangle).
I will instruct you to mark nine special points on your
picture.
<P>
1) Mark the midpoints of each side (3 points).
See FFig(1).
<P>
2) Drop an altitude from each vertex to the opposite side,
and mark the points where the altitudes intersect the
opposite side. (If the triangle is obtuse, an altitude
will be outside the triangle, so extend the opposite side
until it intersects.) See FFig(2).
<P>
3) Notice that the altitudes intersect at a common point.
Mark the midpoint between each vertex and this common point.
See FFig(3).

<P>No matter what triangle you start with,
these nine points all lie on a perfect FFact(circle)!
</P>


Presentation suggestions: Do an example on the board as you give these instructions,
and have students draw their own triangles.  Be sure
to start with an acute triangle first, because the
construction with an obtuse triangle can be confusing.
Also, try not to draw a triangle that is equilateral,
isosceles, or right, because in those degenerate cases,
some of the points will overlap.
Practice before you do one in class!


Behind the fact: Even simple FFact(geometry) still has some surprises in store!
This result was known by Euler in 1765, but rediscovered by
Feuerbach in 1822.  The resulting circle is known as the <i>Feuerbach circle</i> or <i>nine point circle</i>.  The reference contains a proof.
