Title: Slices of Hanging Cubes
Keywords: geometry
Subject: 2
Level: 3
FF Description: <!--needs picture-->
Hang a cube from one of its vertices. Now, if you slice
it horizontally through its center, you get a hexagon.

<P>
What if you do this with a 4-dimensional cube,
i.e., a FFact(tesseract)?  The slice will yield
a 3-dimensional object--- what does it look like?

<P>
Answer: you get a FFact(octahedron)!



Presentation suggestions: Use lower dimensional analogies to help students
visualize higher dimensional objects.




Behind the fact: It is not hard to see (using symmetry arguments)
that the object you get must be regular.  By analogy
with the slice of the 3-cube, the slice of the
4-cube must cut every "face".  The number of "faces"
of a 4-cube is eight.  The only regular 8-sided solid
is an octahedron.

<P>
Visualizing FFact(high dimensional) objects can be taxing,
but fun!
