Title: Area of an Ellipse
Keywords: 
Subject: 3
Level: 1
FF Description: You know the formula for the area of a circle of radius R.
It is Pi*R<sup>2</sup>.

<P>
But what about the formula for the area of an ellipse of
semi-major axis of length A and
semi-minor axis of length B?  (These semi-major axes are half the lengths of, respectively, the largest and smallest diameters of the ellipse--- see FFig(1).)

<P>
For example, the following is a standard equation for such an ellipse centered at the origin:
<center>
(x<sup>2</sup>/A<sup>2</sup>) + (y<sup>2</sup>/B<sup>2</sup>) = 1.
</center>

<P>
The area of such an ellipse is
<center>
Area = Pi * A * B ,
</center>
<br>
a very natural generalization
of the formula for a circle!





Presentation suggestions: If students guess this fact, ask them what they think
the volume of an ellipsoid is!





Behind the fact: One way to see why the formula is true is to realize
that the above FFact(ellipse) is just a unit circle that has been
stretched by a factor A in the x-direction, and a factor
B in the y-direction.  Hence the area of the ellipse
is just A*B times the area of the unit circle.

<P>
The formula can also be proved
using a trigonometric substitution.
For a more interesting proof, use line integrals
and Green's Theorem in FFact(multivariable calculus).

<P>Each of the above proofs will generalize to
show that the volume of an ellipsoid with
semi-axes A, B, and C is just
<center>

(4/3)*Pi*A*B*C.
</center>
<br>
(Just think of a stretched sphere, use trig substitution, or use
an appropriate flux integral.)

<P>By the way, unlike areas, the formula for the <i>length of the perimeter</i> of a circle does not generalize in any nice way to the perimeter of an ellipse, whose arclength is not expressible in closed form--- this difficulty gave rise to the study of the so-called <i>elliptic integrals</i>.
