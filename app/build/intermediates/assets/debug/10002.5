Title: Goldbach's Conjecture
Keywords: unsolved problem, number theory
Subject: 5
Level: 1
FF Description: Here's a famous unsolved problem: is every even
number greater than 2 the sum of 2 FFact(primes)?

<P>
The <I>Goldbach conjecture</I>, dating from
1742, says that the answer is yes.

<P>Some simple examples:
<BR>4=2+2, 6=3+3, 8=3+5, 10=3+7, ..., 100=53+47, ...

<P>What is known so far:
<BR>
Schnirelmann(1930): There is some N such that every
number from some
point onwards can be written as the sum of at most N primes.
<BR>
Vinogradov(1937): Every odd number from some point onwards
can be written as the sum of 3 primes.
<BR>
Chen(1966): Every sufficiently large even integer is the
sum of a prime and an "almost prime" (a number with at
most 2 prime factors).

<P>See the reference for more details.



Presentation suggestions: Have students suggest answers for the first few even
numbers.


Behind the fact: This conjecture has been numerically verified for all even
numbers up to several million.
But that doesn't make it true for all N...
see FFact(Large+Counterexample) for an example of
a conjecture whose first counterexample occurs for
very large N.
