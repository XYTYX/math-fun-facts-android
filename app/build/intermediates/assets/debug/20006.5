Title: Sums of Three and Four Squares
Keywords: sums of squares, number theory
Subject: 5
Level: 2
FF Description: How many squares does it take to express
every whole number as the sum of squares?
We saw that two was not enough in
FFact(Sums+of+Two+Squares).  Perhaps three?  Or four?

<P>
Well, three is not enough, but almost.  The only
whole numbers which cannot be written as the
sum of 3 squares are numbers of the form
4<sup>m</sup>(8k+7).  So you will have problems
writing 7, 15, or 28 as the sum of three squares.

<P>
But <i>every</i> whole number can be written as the
sum of four squares!

<P>Accordingly,
7=2<sup>2</sup>+1<sup>2</sup>+1<sup>2</sup>+1<sup>2</sup>,
and
15=3<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+1<sup>2</sup>+1<sup>2</sup>.



Presentation suggestions: Have the class pick their favorite number and
write it as the sum of four squares.



Behind the fact: The sum of 4 squares result was stated by
Gerard, Fermat, and Diophantus(?), but first proved by
Lagrange in 1770.  It is a classic result in FFact(number theory).
